    "text": "2.1 The data\nThis historical data comes in the form of three tables, as noted on the whalinghistory.org download page and Crew List page:\n\nAmerican Offshore Whaling Voyages database (Lund and Smith 2021-10-20)\n\ncontaining one or more records for each American voyage for which evidence was found—at the least, the name of the vessel and/or master, the port and the approximate date of starting and ending. A basic suite of information is included for most voyages, and usually substantial additional information is included on the ship’s capacity and rig, declared destination, and amount of whale products. Basic biographical information about the master is included where known.\n\nAmerican Offshore Whaling Logbook database (Lund and Smith 2018-04-01)\n\ncontaining records transcribed from whaling log books giving information on the whales seen and captured, and the date and the location of the vessel. These data were extracted from the original whaling logbooks during three separate scientific research projects, one conducted by Lt. Cmdr. Matthew Fontaine Maury in the 1850s, the second conducted by Charles Haskins Townsend in the 1930s, and the third conducted by a team from the Census of Marine Life project (CoML, www.coml.org) between 2000 and 2010. Data from each separate project is also available here.\n\nAmerican Offshore Whaling Crew Lists (Lund and Smith 2020-03-02).\n\nCrew lists for whaling voyages recorded at the customs houses in New Bedford, Fall River, and Salem, Massachusetts, and in New London, Connecticut, have been compiled as part of various projects and from various sources over the years. We have gathered these crew lists in a single searchable, sortable database.\n\n\n\nI make two simplifying assumptions without attempting to justify them:\n\nThe voyages in this dataset are a sufficiently good representation of all American whaling voyages to make general statements about the rise, decline, and some characteristics of the American whaling industry\nData quality issues do not overly compromise this purpose, particularly after using the techniques summarized in Section 11.1 Dealing with errors, duplicates, and omissions."

    "section": "2.2 Why whaling?",
    "text": "2.2 Why whaling?\nPrior to the industrial revolution, products derived from whales included oils for lanterns, candles and other purposes, high-quality wax, and strong rods and plates that today would be made of plastic or metal. See the good Whales and hunting overview at www.whalingmuseum.org .\n\n2.2.1 The whales and the products derived from them\n\n\n\nSperm and right whales were most commonly hunted for sperm oil (a liquid wax) and whale oil respectively. Species hunted for their baleen included humpback, bowhead, right, and gray. The records include a relatively small number of non-whales: pilot whales, orca (killer whales; formerly called grampus whales), and dolphins. Fin whales (also called finback whales), though large and having baleen, were not hunted much when whalers used open boats. Once steam-powered ships and explosive harpoons made it safer for crews, and once other species became rarer, harvesting fin whales became more common. In this data set one does not see this significant, later trend. See Section 7.1 Most Common Species and Section 7.2 Less Common Species.\nWhaling crews logged encounters with whales in their logbooks. The logbook table standardizes these encounters into sightings and strikes (harpooning). Each encounter may have included more than one whale. Tries indicate the number of whales that were processed by the crew after a recorded strike. Sometimes the logs recorded “whale” without identifying the species. In the dataset this occurred in 29% of the encounters. Looking at where “whale” encounters occurred, they seem to be a mix of Sperm and Right whales. In total the data set includes the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.1:  Summary of whale species encountered \n  \n    \n      Encounters(sightings or strikes)\n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      species\n      n1\n      pct\n    \n  \n  \n    Sperm\n22,543\n31.4%\n    Whale\n20,975\n29.2%\n    Right\n15,031\n21.0%\n    Finback\n3,759\n5.2%\n    Pilot\n2,750\n3.8%\n    Bowhead\n2,277\n3.2%\n    Humpback\n2,266\n3.2%\n    Orca\n1,333\n1.9%\n    Gray\n556\n0.8%\n    Blue\n229\n0.3%\n    Dolphin\n16\n0.0%\n    Total\n71,735\n100.0%\n  \n  \n  \n    \n      1 A sighting or strike involved one or more (sometimes many more) animals\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nWhale names have changed over the years. Finback are more commonly called fin whales today; orca are also known as killer whales and previously were known as grampus whales.\nAs seen in Figure 7.26, harvesting right and sperm whales peaked in the 1840s, pilot and bowhead whales in the 1850s, and the other less common species in the 1860s and 1870s. See Chapter 7 Whales and Chapter 8 Products."

Crews were paid according to the lay system: a portion of net profits after expenses. The financial returns for investers and crew of the higher ranks (positions) were uncertain but overall very attractive in the mid nineteenth century, declining over the decades until the industrial revolution offered better return on investment for those with capital and more attractive options for crew, including more certain wages that did not require them to be away from home for months or years at a time.

    "text": "3.1 What was it like to work on a whaling ship?\nThe US National Park Service’s New Bedford Historical Park website offers this summary:\n\nThough the sea is traditionally understood as romantic landscape, whaling was not a romantic business. In the earliest years of the industry, whalemen were from seafaring communities and were brought up to view the ship as their workplace.\nIn addition to being dirty and dangerous, whaling was monotonous work. Life onboard consisted of long periods of boredom; for weeks, even months, no whales would be seen. The crew would repair gear, write letters, play games and music, and carve scrimshaw — pieces of whale bone or tooth — to pass the time. Food and water would often become foul, and fights would break out among the crew because of the uncomfortable conditions. Men of all ranks and races faced danger from injury, illness, shipwreck, drowning, and piracy.\nWhale sightings equated to short bursts of excitement as the men rushed to catch the whale, and then kill and process it.\n\n\nFor more insight, see the good overview article Whaling The Old Way: Life on a nineteenth-century whaler was thrilling, tedious, and often disgusting (Williford 2012)."

It seems Townsend was only interested in observations when there was a strike (and mainly recorded year_out and year_in without additional date information), CoML gathered daily observations where possible, and Maury was somewhere in the middle. Thus where there were duplicate logbook records, I favored CoML then Maury over Townsend when preparing a set of distinct voyages. In all places referring to logbook records I use this consolidate set.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.9: Source of logbook information - voyages with some simulated date data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe median voyage duration was 590 days (1.6 years).

Thus at least through the 1860s it’s likely that the data set under-reports the number of negro crew. Is this a sign of abolitionist protest among the whaling masters or their syndicates? Or perhaps the employment of runaway slaves?\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.11: Percentage skin color in crews by decade"

    "section": "6.6 Profit sharing: the lay system",
    "text": "6.6 Profit sharing: the lay system\nAs noted in Chapter 9 Financial Returns, profit sharing motivated crew and investors alike. A crew member’s share was determined by his rank and whatever special skills he had or considerations he could negotiate. In Moby Dick, Ishmael in his ignorance gets a laughably small share:\n\nPeleg now threw open a chest, and drawing forth the ship’s articles, placed pen and ink before him, and seated himself at a little table. I began to think it was high time to settle with myself at what terms I would be willing to engage for the voyage. I was already aware that in the whaling business they paid no wages; but all hands, including the captain, received certain shares of the profits called lays, and that these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the ship’s company. I was also aware that being a green hand at whaling, my own lay would not be very large; but considering that I was used to the sea, could steer a ship, splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt that from all I had heard I should be offered at least the 275th lay—that is, the 275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage, whatever that might eventually amount to. And though the 275th lay was what they call a rather LONG LAY, yet it was better than nothing; and if we had a lucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I would wear out on it, not to speak of my three years’ beef and board, for which I would not have to pay one stiver.\nIt might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely fortune—and so it was, a very poor way indeed. But I am one of those that never take on about princely fortunes, and am quite content if the world is ready to board and lodge me, while I am putting up at this grim sign of the Thunder Cloud. Upon the whole, I thought that the 275th lay would be about the fair thing, but would not have been surprised had I been offered the 200th, considering I was of a broad-shouldered make…(Melville 1851)\n\n\n\n6.6.1 Ranks and lays\nThe crew most skilled at running the ship and handling the cargo received the largest lays. Consider, for example, the relatively large share that went to the cooper: since whale and sperm oil (and baleen too?) were stored in barrels, an incompetent cooper could turn a successful voyage into a financial disaster.\nFor the sake of clarity, below I use percentages instead of fractions (1/12th, 1/100th, etc.).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.14: Profit sharing percentages by number of crew in each rank\n\n\n\n\n\nThere were a lot of relatively low-skilled crew who received very little payout. The linear scales below in Figure Figure 6.15 make that more obvious:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.15: Profit sharing percentages varied widely by job role\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the same data as a cumulative density plot, it’s easier to see that more than two-thirds of the crew received less than one percent of the profit.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.16: More than two thirds of the crew got less than 1% of profits each\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was more variation in the shares of the higher-paying ranks:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.17: Profit sharing percentages varied widely - most common ranks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.6.2 Aside: some lays were expressed differently\nIn 447 crew records the lay is expressed in the form of \\(\\frac{x}{M}\\) rather than \\(\\frac{1}{x}\\). I am unsure what this means compared to lays expressed as simple fractions (\\(\\frac{1}{x}\\)). So I look at them separately below.\nI treat each of the following as equivalent, assuming imprecision in how they were recorded rather than accepting that some crew of the same rank were paid 1,000 times more than others:\n\\[\\frac{.10c}{M},\\  \\frac{10c}{M},\\  and\\  \\frac{10}{M}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.18: Profit sharing expressed as x/M by rank"

    "section": "7.11 Whale species today",
    "text": "7.11 Whale species today\nAs with many other kinds natural resources, the common mentality in eighteen, nineteenth, and early twentieth centuries was that whales were there for the taking, and as one species became rare whalers moved on to others. The long shadow of commercial whaling is the near extinction of many whale species.\n\n\n7.11.1 Right whales\nAs noted in the NOAA Fisheries Species Catalog (“Species Directory: Northern Right Whale” 2022-08-04) (“Species Directory: Southern Right Whale” 2022-08-04)\n\nNorth Pacific right whales are one of the rarest of all large whale species and among the rarest of all marine mammal species. Two other species of right whale exist in the world’s oceans: the North Atlantic right whale, which is found in the North Atlantic Ocean, and the southern right whale, which is found in the southern hemisphere. North Pacific right whales are baleen whales, which feed by straining huge volumes of ocean water through their comb-like baleen plates that trap copepods and other zooplankton.\nCommercial whaling greatly reduced right whale populations in the Pacific Ocean. Whaling is no longer a threat, but human activity such as entanglement in fishing gear and marine debris, vessel strikes, impacts from climate change, Oil and gas development, and ocean noise, continue to endanger this species.\nThere are no reliable estimates of current abundance or trends for right whales in the North Pacific. There are likely fewer than 500 North Pacific right whales remaining, and most sightings have been of single whales, though small groups have been sighted. Only about 30 individuals are estimated to remain of the Eastern stock that visits Alaskan waters.\n\n\n\n\n7.11.2 Sperm whales\nAs noted in the NOAA Fisheries Species Catalog (“Species Directory: Sperm Whale” 2022-08-04)\n\nSperm whales are the largest of the toothed whales and have one of the widest global distributions of any marine mammal species. They are found in all deep oceans, from the equator to the edge of the pack ice in the Arctic and Antarctic.\nThey are named after the waxy substance—spermaceti—found in their heads. The spermaceti is an oil sac that helps the whales focus sound. Spermaceti was used in oil lamps, lubricants, and candles. Sperm whales were a primary target of the commercial whaling industry from 1800 to 1987, which nearly decimated all sperm whale populations. While whaling is no longer a major threat, sperm whale populations are still recovering. The sperm whale is listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act and depleted under the Marine Mammal Protection Act… The International Whaling Commission placed a moratorium on commercial whaling in 1986. The species is still recovering, and its numbers are likely increasing.\n\n\n\n\n7.11.3 Finback (fin) whales\nAs noted in the NOAA Fisheries Species Catalog (“Species Directory: Fin Whale” 2022-08-04)\n\nThe fin whale is the second-largest whale species on earth, second only to the blue whale. It is found throughout the world’s oceans. It gets its name from an easy-to-spot fin on its back, near its tail.\nLike all large whales, fin whales were hunted by commercial whalers, which severely lowered their populations. Whalers did not target them at first, because they were fast swimmers and lived in open ocean habitats. But, as whaling methods modernized with steam-powered ships and explosive harpoons, and whalers decimated other easy-to-catch species, whaling turned to fin whales. This industry killed a huge number during the mid-1900s—nearly 725,000 in the Southern Hemisphere alone.\nWhaling is no longer a threat for fin whales (commercial whaling ended in the 1970s and 1980s, though some subsistence hunting continues today in Greenland under sustainable quotas allowed by the International Whaling Commission). Currently, the major threat to this species comes from vessel strikes. The fin whale is listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act and depleted under the Marine Mammal Protection Act.\n\n\n\n\n7.11.4 Pilot whales\nAs noted in the NOAA Fisheries Species Catalog (“Species Directory: Pilot Whale” 2022-08-14)\n\nLong-finned pilot whales are very social, living in large schools of hundreds of animals separated into close-knit pods of 10 to 20 individuals. This structure made them easy targets for whaling in the 19th and 20th centuries. Whalers would drive and herd pilot whales together into tight groups to harpoon them, hunting them for their meat, oil, and blubber.\nLong-finned pilot whales are one of two species of pilot whale, along with short-finned pilot whales. In the field and at sea, it is very difficult to distinguish the two species, which differ only slightly in physical size, features, coloration, and pattern.\n\n\n\n\n7.11.5 Bowhead whales\nAs noted in the NOAA Fisheries Species Catalog (“Species Directory: Bowhead Whale” 2022-08-14)\n\nBowhead whales are one of the few whale species that reside almost exclusively in Arctic and subarctic waters experiencing seasonal sea ice coverage, primarily between 60° and 75° north latitude. Of all large whales, the bowhead is the most adapted to life in icy water. Adaptations to this environment include an insulating layer of blubber that can be up to 1.6 feet thick.\nCommercial whaling for bowheads off Alaska began in the early 1800s, and lasted until the early 1900s. The economic value of the bowheads’ oil and baleen, combined with their slow swimming speeds and tendency to float when killed, made them a prime target for whalers. By the time commercial whaling of bowheads effectively ended in 1921, the worldwide bowhead abundance had declined to less than 3,000 whales. Today, bowhead whales may still be threatened by loss of food sources, climate change, vessel strikes, entanglement in fishing gear, ocean noise, offshore oil and gas development, pollution, and predation.\nCommercial whaling severely reduced bowhead whale numbers from historical levels. The worldwide number of bowheads prior to commercial exploitation is estimated at a minimum of 50,000, including an estimated 10,400 to 23,000 whales in the Western Arctic stock, the stock found in U.S. waters. Commercial whaling drove global abundance down to less than 3,000 by the 1920s.\nThe United States listed all bowhead whales as endangered under the Endangered Species Conservation Act in 1970 and the Endangered Species Act in 1973. Bowhead whales are also listed as depleted under the Marine Mammal Protection Act.\nWestern Arctic bowheads have shown considerable recovery since the end of commercial whaling in the early 1900s, and they now comprise the largest population of bowheads in the world. The most recent abundance estimate for the Western Arctic bowhead stock, collected during spring 2019, indicates there are approximately 12,505 Western Arctic bowheads, with a 95 percent confidence interval ranging from 7,994 to 19,560 whales.\nHowever, the smaller Okhotsk Sea population, more heavily exploited in the past, remains at a dangerously low population of only a few hundred individuals. Genetic research has shown that these two North Pacific populations are distinct, indicating that movement of individuals between the two populations is rare.\n\n\n\n\n7.11.6 Humpback whales\nAs noted in the NOAA Fisheries Species Catalog (“Species Directory: Humpback Whale” 2022-08-14)\n\nBefore a final moratorium on commercial whaling in 1985, all populations of humpback whales were greatly reduced, most by more than 95 percent. The species is increasing in abundance throughout much of its range but faces threats from entanglement in fishing gear, vessel strikes, vessel-based harassment, and underwater noise.\nHumpback whales live in all oceans around the world. They travel great distances every year and have one of the longest migrations of any mammal on the planet. Some populations swim 5,000 miles from tropical breeding grounds to colder, more productive feeding grounds. Humpback whales feed on shrimp-like crustaceans (krill) and small fish, straining huge volumes of ocean water through their baleen plates, which act like a sieve….\nCommercial whaling severely reduced humpback whale numbers from historical levels. The United States listed all humpback whales as endangered under the Endangered Species Conservation Act in 1970 and then under the Endangered Species Act in 1973. NOAA Fisheries worked worldwide to identify and apply protections for humpback whales. The International Whaling Commission’s final whaling moratorium on commercial harvest, in effect since 1985, played a major role in the recovery of humpback whales. Currently, four out of the 14 distinct population segments are still protected as endangered, and one is listed as threatened (81 FR 62259, September 2016). Three humpback whale stocks in U.S. waters are designated as depleted under the Marine Mammal Protection Act.\n\n\n\n\n7.11.7 Orca (killer whale or grampus)\nAs noted in the NOAA Fisheries Species Catalog (“Species Directory: Killer Whale” 2022-08-14)\n\nThe killer whale, also known as orca, is the ocean’s top predator. It is the largest member of the Delphinidae family, or dolphins. Members of this family include all dolphin species, as well as other larger species, such as long-finned pilot whales and short-finned pilot whales, whose common names also contain “whale” instead of “dolphin.”\nFound in every ocean in the world, they are the most widely distributed of all cetaceans (whales and dolphins). Scientific studies have revealed many different populations with several distinct ecotypes (or forms) of killer whales worldwide—some of which may be different species or subspecies. They are one of the most recognizable marine mammals, with their distinctive black and white bodies. Globally, killer whales occur in a wide range of habitats, in both open seas and coastal waters. Taken as a whole, the species has the most varied diet of all cetaceans, but different populations are usually specialized in their foraging behavior and diet. They often use a coordinated hunting strategy, working as a team like a pack of wolves.\nHunters and fishermen once targeted killer whales. As a result, historical threats to killer whales included commercial hunting and culling to protect fisheries from killer whales. In addition, although live capture of killer whales for aquarium display and marine parks no longer occurs in the United States, it continues to remain a threat globally. Today, some killer whale populations face many other threats, including food limitations, chemical contaminants, and disturbances from vessel traffic and sound. Efforts to establish critical habitat, set protective regulations, and restore prey stocks are essential to conservation, especially for the endangered Southern Resident killer whale population….\nSeveral different populations and ecotypes of killer whales are found throughout the world. NOAA Fisheries estimates population size in our stock assessment reports. It is estimated that there are around 50,000 killer whales globally. Approximately 2,500 killer whales live in the eastern North Pacific Ocean—home to the most well-studied killer whale populations.\nIn recent decades, several populations of killer whales have declined and some have become endangered. The population of AT1 Transients, a stock of Transient killer whales in the eastern North Pacific, has been reduced from 22 to 7 whales since the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. In 2004, NOAA Fisheries designated this stock as depleted under the MMPA based on the results of the status review (PDF, 25 pages).\nScientists estimate the minimum historical population size of Southern Residents in the eastern North Pacific was about 140 animals. Following live-capture in the 1960s for use in marine mammal parks, 71 animals remained in 1974. Although there was some growth in the population in the 1970s and 1980s, with a peak of 98 animals in 1995, the population experienced a decline of almost 20 percent in the late 1990s, leaving 80 whales in 2001. The 2020 population census counted only 72 whales, and three new calves have been born following the census bringing the total of this struggling population to 75. In 2003, NOAA Fisheries began a research and conservation program with congressional funding to address the dwindling population. Southern Residents were listed as Endangered in 2005 under the ESA and a recovery plan was completed in 2008.\n\n\n\n\n7.11.8 Gray whales\nAs noted in the NOAA Fisheries Species Catalog (“Species Directory: Gray Whale” 2022-08-14)\n\nOnce common throughout the Northern Hemisphere, gray whales are now only regularly found in the North Pacific Ocean where there are two extant populations, one in the eastern and one in the western North Pacific.\nGray whales earned the nickname “devil fish” because of their aggressive reactions when harpooned. Commercial whaling rapidly brought both Pacific populations to near extinction. International conservation measures were enacted in the 1930s and 1940s to protect whales from over-exploitation, and in the mid-1980s the International Whaling Commission instituted a moratorium on commercial whaling.\nGray whales are known for their curiosity toward boats in some locations and are the focus of whale watching and ecotourism along the west coast of North America. Gray whales make one of the longest annual migrations of any mammal, traveling about 10,000 miles round-trip and in some cases upwards of 14,000 miles. On their migration routes they face threats from vessel strikes, entanglement in fishing gear, and other sources of disturbance….\nNOAA Fisheries estimates the population size (also called a stock) for gray whales in its stock assessment reports. Shore-based observers have conducted systematic counts of eastern North Pacific gray whales migrating south along the central California coast in most years since 1967. All gray whale stocks are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. The eastern stock or Distinct Population Segment (DPS) was once listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act but successfully recovered and was delisted in 1994. The western stock or DPS remains very low in number and is listed as endangered under the ESA and depleted under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. The western stock is estimated to include fewer than 300 individuals based on photo-identification data collected off Sakhalin Island and southeastern Kamchatka, Russia.\n\n\n\n\n7.11.9 Blue whales\nAs noted in the NOAA Fisheries Species Catalog (“Species Directory: Blue Whale” 2022-08-14)\n\nBlue whales are the largest animals ever to live on our planet. They feed almost exclusively on krill, straining huge volumes of ocean water through their baleen plates (which hang from the roof of the mouth and work like a sieve). Some of the biggest individuals may eat up to 6 tons of krill a day.\nBlue whales are found in all oceans except the Arctic Ocean. There are five currently recognized subspecies of blue whales.\nThe number of blue whales today is only a small fraction of what it was before modern commercial whaling significantly reduced their numbers during the early 1900s, but populations are increasing globally. The primary threats blue whales currently face are vessel strikes and entanglements in fishing gear….\nBlue whales were significantly depleted by commercial whaling activities worldwide. Today, blue whales are listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act and protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. The latest stock assessment reports of blue whales include data for various stocks, including areas of the North Pacific and western North Atlantic Oceans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Finback Whale.” 2020.

One in particular is that it retains its lubricating qualities in extreme temperatures making it ideal for light, rapid machinery. Another feature is its superb qualities of illumination. It burns very clearly and brightly and without smoke or odor. Great quantities of sperm oil went into public and private lighting as well as lighthouses. A byproduct of the sperm oil refining process was high quality soap. About half of the crude sperm oil obtained by American vessels at the height of the fishery was exported to other countries.

    "text": "8.2 Whale oil\n\nOtherwise known as “train oil” the whale oils are varying shades of brown in color, depending upon the age of the blubber from which they were boiled and the general health of the animal from which they were obtained. Whale oils were the first of all oils — animal or mineral — to achieve commercial importance. The principle sources for whale oil in the days of Yankee whaling were right whales, bowhead whales and humpback whales. Yankee whaling merchants sometimes adopted the phrase “brown oil is better than no oil,” in their instructions to their ship captains meaning that rather than return home without having filled the ship with sperm oil, they were to take other whales instead. Whale oil has an ancient history having been used in medieval Europe as an illuminant and a lubricant as well as food. It saw new uses during the 19th century Industrial Revolution both in Europe and America in the tempering of steel, screw cutting and cordage manufacture. It continued to be used as an illuminant particularly in the headlamps of miners. By-products of the whale oil refining process were soap and stearin a material that was added to spermaceti to decrease its brittleness and to make a smoother burning candle.

If these voyages are representative of the industry, yields dropped through the 1840s as more ships entered the hunt, then increased again, presumably due to more effective methods or seeking more productive grounds that weren’t fished out.\n\n8.4.1 Introduction\nThe units of product used in the Voyages table are noted here. I have changed the units to make it easier to plot all three products together:\n\nbone: quantity of whalebone or baleen returned, in pounds\nsperm: quantity of sperm oil returned, in gallons (originally, in barrels)\noil: quantity of whale oil returned, in gallons (originally, in barrels)\n\nThe Voyages table includes product yield and (in most cases) voyage start and end dates. I filtered out voyages likely to misrepresent the results, for example, voyages shorter than 200 km, which leaves 2,766 voyages. See Section 11.1 Dealing with errors, duplicates, and omissions for details.\nThe Logbook table includes records for a subset of the voyages in the Voyages table and includes latitude and longitude on specific days. From this I calculated distances for the XX voyages that report returning with at least one product.\nTo improve clarity in the following plots I did the following:\n\nUse LOESS lines to summarize the data presented in scatter plots.\nLimit the time frame displayed to 1800-1900.

    "section": "9.1 The New Bedford business model",
    "text": "9.1 The New Bedford business model\nAs noted in The Economist (“Fin-Tech: Before There Were Tech Startups, There Was Whaling” 2015):\n\nOverall returns in the whaling business in New Bedford between 1817 and 1892 averaged 14% a year—an impressive record by any standard.\nNew Bedford was not the only whaling port in America; nor was America the only whaling nation. Yet according to a study published in 1859, of the 900-odd active whaling ships around the world in 1850, 700 were American, and 70% of those came from New Bedford. The town’s whalers came to dominate the industry, and reap immense profits, thanks to a novel technology that remains relevant to this day. They did not invent a new type of ship, or a new means of tracking whales; instead, they developed a new business model that was extremely effective at marshalling capital and skilled workers despite the immense risks involved for both.\nThe whaling industry…was one of the first to grapple with the difficulty of aligning incentives among owners, managers and employees, according to Tom Nicholas and Jonas Peter Akins of Harvard Business School. In this model, there was no state backing. Managers held big stakes in the business, giving them every reason to attend to the interests of the handful of outside investors. Their stakes were held through carefully constructed syndicates and rarely traded; everyone was, financially at least, on board for the entire voyage. Payment for the crew came from a cut of the profits, giving them a pressing interest in the success of the voyage as well. As a consequence, decision-making could be delegated down to the point where it really mattered, to the captain and crew in the throes of the hunt, when risk and return were palpable….\nAt the top of the New Bedford hierarchy was an agent or firm of agents like Gideon Allen, responsible for the purchase and outfitting of the ship, the hiring of the crew and the sale of the catch. To give them an incentive to cut the best deals possible, the agents put up a big share of the investment. Those with the best reputation received better terms from the other investors. Captains, who ran the show while the ship was at sea, often put up capital as well. A similar system of incentives is used in the riskier reaches of the investment-management business today, notes Mr Nicholas.\nInvestors received half to two-thirds of the profits. The rest was divided among the crew in what was known as the “lay” system. A captain might get a 12th lay (one-twelfth of the remaining profit)…..\nEvery participant wanted to bring in returns quickly, but there were no artificial deadlines—nothing resembling what is now called “quarterly capitalism”. When whales became rare in accessible places, the crews from New Bedford extended their search to every corner of every ocean, however many years that took.\nTo ensure that they were not ruined by a few disastrous voyages, the whaling firms invested in multiple expeditions at the same time, much as the venture capitalists of today “spray and pray”. A study published in 1997 concluded that, of the 787 boats launched from New Bedford during the 18th century, 272 sank or were destroyed. The firm that belonged to George Howland was not atypical: of its 15 ships, between four and nine were at sea at any given moment. One was sunk by a whale, three lost at sea, two burned by their crews, one destroyed by a Confederate gunboat during America’s civil war and five abandoned in Arctic ice. Yet Howland died a millionaire in 1852.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.1: The Charles W. Morgan moored at Mystic Seaport, CT (The Charles w. Morgan at Mystic Seaport 2019)"

    "text": "9.2 The case of the Charles W. Morgan\nThe Charles W. Morgan was commissioned in 1841 from New Bedford, MA, and now is preserved at The Mystic Seaport Museum. Staff there compiled Statistical and Financial Results of the 37 Voyages of the ship Charles W. Morgan, helps to make concrete some of dynamics in the whaling industry. We should keep in mind the document’s provisos:\n\nIt should be noted that over the years during which the Charles W. Morgan was active, there were great fluctuations in the prices of the various commodities. For example, the price of sperm oil rose as high as $2.27 per gallon in 1867 and dropped as low as $0.30 per gallon in 1920. Whalebone rose from a low of $0.34 per pound in 1845 to a high of $5.35 per pound in 1892. Prices of the various commodities also fluctuated widely within a given year.\nIn 1868 some Grade A whale oil sold for $0.78 per gallon in New Bedford in May, whereas the average price for the whole year was $1.02. At the same time, some whalebone sold for $0.86 per pound, although the average price for the year was $1.24 per pound. On the other hand, some sperm oil sold for $1.80 per gallon in May, while the average price for the year was $1.78 per gallon.\nPrices varied according to the quality of the product. The types of oil were sometimes separated into Grade A (best quality), Grade B (“dark and sour”), and Grade C (“black and stinking”). Bone prices varied according to length and place of origin. Long bone and that from the Arctic were more valuable than short pieces and that from the South Seas (See Elmo P. Hohman, The American Whaleman, p. 292).\n\nPrices for whale oil peaked in the 1860s; sperm oil peaked shortly after. Both then entered a period of price decline that never recovered. Additionally, inflation over this time period further reduced real returns.\nThe collapse of sperm and whale oil prices suggests the main dynamic was a collapse in demand rather than supply (as would have been the case if whales had become too rare to meet demand).\nIn contrast, the price for baleen bone spiked in the 1890s, and the continuing high price for baleen bone when sales ended raises the question: Why did the owners of the Charles W. Morgan switch in 1906 from using the port of San Franciso as a base to hunt whales in the Pacific, returning the ship to the original port of New Bedford and hunting sperm oil and whale oil in the Atlantic? Did the population of baleen whales collapse in the Pacific? Was it too costly to fit out the ship on the West coast? Was the ship too old and of questionable seaworthiness? Were there other reasons? The home ports and hunting areas are listed in Appendix Section 11.6 Charles W. Morgan’s voyages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.2: Sale prices for Charles W. Morgan’s product\n\n\n\n\n\nRevenue peaked in the 1860s and declined as prices declined. There isn’t much difference between nominal dollars and 1845 dollars (adjusted based on estimated CPI (“Consumer Price Index, 1800-” 2022-08-26)) since inflation was low during this period (see Figure 11.2 Inflation (consumer price index) during the years of the Charles W. Morgan’s operation in the Appendix. For this reason, the other plots in this section are not adjusted for inflation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.3: Revenue for Charles W. Morgan’s product each voyage\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was advantageous to collect multiple products, since a crew didn’t know how many and what kinds of whales they would encounter.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.4: Revenue by product from Charles W.

From the perspective of an investor in the Charles W. Morgan’s voyages, was it a good investment?\nLet’s apply some hypothetical costs to the Charles W. Morgan’s voyages. These numbers may vary significantly from the actual numbers, which are not at hand, and as a convenience I’m simplifying matters. For example, fitting out for multi-year journeys cost more than short ones; I’m ignoring that.\nIn this simplified model of investment and return I use these hypothetical values (a.k.a. assumptions) for the three main costs to the investors:\n\nCost to build the ship: $45,000 as noted in Whaling Ships – A Few Historical Details (Bierle 2017-06-15) and recognized over the first two voyages.\nCost to fit out the ship for a voyage, including supplies needed for the crew: $7,000. This is a wild guess. Let’s assume it includes wharf fees, repairs, supplies, interest on money borrowed, insurance, and any other non-crew costs.\nCost of the crew (percent of profits less cost of voyage paid at the voyage’s end). Assume 33.0% based on (“Whales and Hunting” 2022-08-18). A master could earn \\(\\frac{1}{8}^{th}\\) (12.5%) share (Thorndike 2015) so let’s assume the rest of the crew shared 20.5%.\n\n\n\n\nAnnual returns of 19.7% would be quite good (were these numbers real). This is net of expenses and before taxes.\nAlso of note: the shorter voyages in the Pacific that started in the 1880s maintained a similar level of returns, which dropped only around the time the C.W. Morgan returned to the Atlantic in 1906.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.5: Hypothetical investors’ view: cumulative return from Charles W. Morgan’s voyages"

To explore this, I use the prices paid at the end of each Charles W. Morgan voyage as reference points by doing the following:\n\nFocus on the years when the Charles W. Morgan was in operation, since I have easily-accessible reference prices for this period.\nUse a spline to interpolate prices in years the Morgan was at sea and didn’t sell product; this avoids large step changes year-to-year in references prices.\nUse these reference prices to estimate the revenue resulting from all voyages for which there exists year_in data in this period.\nSince voyages were of varying duration, also look at normalized returns, for example: revenue per day for voyages for which there is sufficient data.\n\nThe resulting revenue estimates for other voyages are definitely imperfect, however they likely are in the neighborhood and useful for looking at the revenue distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReference prices used to estimate voyage revenue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.4.1 Returns by voyage\n\n\n\nThe revenue histogram below includes all voyages with year_in data.

    "text": "9.5 Summary\nOver time the volume of product harvested declined, prices declined, inflation took its bite, and whereas for a while there were three primary products that provided a means to spread the risk, ventures became increasingly dependent on sperm oil (see Section 7.6 Relative portion by species per decade). Not shown here (but explained below), cost of wages rose as the industrial revolution gained momentum, and American whaling lost its competitive edge compared to other countries.\nPerhaps in response to these changing dynamics, the Charles W. Morgan undertook multi-year voyages until about 1885, then mostly yearly voyages.\nDerek Thompson provides a good summary of some of the dynamics that brought the American Whaling movement to an end in The Spectacular Rise and Fall of U.S. Whaling: An Innovation Story (Thompson 2012):\n\nIn the middle of the 19th century, whale oil prices increased, which should have led to more production. But output never recovered after the 1850s even as whaling continued to grow around the world. Why did Americans give up?\nThe answer from Davis, Gallman, and Gleiter will also look familiar to a modern business audience: US workers got too darn expensive, and other countries stole our share of the whale business.\nThanks to the dry-land industrial revolution, “higher wages, higher opportunity costs of capital, and a plethora of entrepreneurial alternatives turned Americans toward the domestic economy,” the authors write. Meanwhile, slower growth overseas made whaling more attractive to other countries. “Lower wages, lower opportunity costs of capital, and a lack of entrepreneurial alternatives pushed [people like the] Norwegians into exploiting the whale stocks,” they continue.\nBetween the 1860s and the 1880s the wages of average US workers grew by a third, making us three times more expensive than your typical Norwegian seaman. Whales aren’t national resources. They’re supranational resources. They belong to whomever can hunt them most efficiently. With all the benefits of modern whaling technology and workers at a third the price, Norway and other countries snagged a greater share of the world’s whales.\nAs the costs of whaling grew, capitalists funneled their cash into other domestic industries: notably railroads, oil, and steel. When New Bedford’s whaling elite opened the city’s first cotton mill and petroleum-refining plant, the harpoon had been firmly lodged inside the heart of American whaling. Ishmael complained famously, in the first paragraph of Moby Dick, of having “nothing particular to interest me on shore,” so he struck out to earn a living wage at sea. In the second half of Melville’s century, the industrial revolution lured young men without means to factories rather than the ocean. Capital beckoned the nation’s Ishmaels to the machines, away from the watery parts of the world.\n\nIt’s likely that at least as influential as labor costs were the characteristics of alternative investment opportunities: closer to home, lower risk, with potential to grow larger than whaling and provide correspondingly higher returns. The industrial revolution was the “next big thing”.\n\n\n\n\n\nBierle, Sarah Kay. 2017-06-15. “Whaling Ships – a Few Historical Details.” web page. 2017-06-15. https://gazette665.com/2017/06/15/whaling-ships-a-few-historical-details/.\n\n\n“Consumer Price Index, 1800-.” 2022-08-26.

    "section": "11.1 Dealing with errors, duplicates, and omissions",
    "text": "11.1 Dealing with errors, duplicates, and omissions\nHand-written records have errors. Many people in many locations over more than 150 years wrote entries in paper ledgers as part of their normal work. Men on each voyage wrote daily entries in the ships’ logs. Spellings varied. Abbreviations were inconsistently applied. Some entries are illegible. Some are simply missing. A portion of this data was heroically transcribed into electronic records and made available freely for others to use–including in this work.\nBelow I summarize actions I took to make the best use of the data at hand and to minimize the chance of misleading presentation or inference. Since this is a descriptive, informal analysis and not one that could be used to make decisions, I have favored simplicity over rigor in my assumptions and techniques.\n\n11.1.1 Voyages\n\nSources of log data\nAs noted in Section 3.4 Observations in the logbooks, Townsend transcribed only a small subset of the daily log data, resulting in under-reporting sightings and strikes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuplicate voyage data\nThe dataset includes some duplicates of voyages arising from the use of three sources (in chronological order): Townsend, Maury and Census on Marine Life (CoML). Where there are duplicates, I take CoML over the others and Maury over Townsend.\n\n\nLimited detailed log data\nAs seen in Figure 3.4 there is log data for 1,346 of the 15,608 voyages (8.6%). Even though the detailed logs are a convenience sample (no effort has been made to select voyages randomly or in a way that is stratified by some meaningful characteristic), I assume the voyages for which detailed logs are not available are reasonably similar in nature and distribution to ones for which there is log data.\n\n\nSimulated voyage day_in and/or year_in data\nSimulated day_out and day_in (and in some cases year_in) data provides more than four times the number of voyages to work with (compare Figure 3.6 and Figure 3.7. The simulated days use the frequencies in the complete data to weight the randomly selected simulated data.\n\n\nVoyage log gaps\n\nFor analysis, voyages that have a gap of more than a year between observations have been dropped, since I assume the data is too poor to use. In this case the voyage could be (and perhaps should be) categorized as two separate voyages.\nFor plotting, voyages that have a gap in the logs of more than seven days have been dropped.\nI manually viewed all tracks that passed the above filters, and identified a subset as good tracks for plotting. I excluded ones with widely misplaced points (likely a data error), or gaps that led to tracks crossing land masses when plotting the segment between the points.\n\n\n\n\n11.1.2 Voyage outlier data likely to be data errors\nIn some cases I removed a small number of the largest data poitns that were implausably larger than the next highest values. For example, in product_per_day calculated from the Logbook table joined to the Voyages table:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Top values of product_per_day are more than 100x the median valuemore than the next highest values\n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      voyage_id\n      voyage_name\n      metric\n      metric_value\n      multiple_of_median\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      oil\n    \n    AV17136\nPioneer : 1880\nprod_per_day\n3,938\n163\n    AV17275\nSeychelle : 1853\nprod_per_day\n945\n39\n    AV05614\nGeorge and Martha : 1845\nprod_per_day\n394\n16\n    AV16788\nThomas Pope : 1881\nprod_per_day\n336\n14\n    AV10935\nOrca : 1887\nprod_per_day\n336\n14\n    \n      sperm\n    \n    AV17136\nPioneer : 1880\nprod_per_day\n3,402\n170\n    AV13209\nSolon : 1844\nprod_per_day\n2,362\n118\n    AV02737\nCharles W.

The voyages data set include multiple tonnages for many ships represented in the form: “218/130/145”; this example is from the bark A. R. Tucker (vessel AS0020) for which the data set includes voyages starting in 1851 and ending in 1906. Since the years of each configuration are not included, I used the largest number. Thus the plot of tonnage by decade in Section 4.2 may overstate vessels’ tonnage in their early or late years, when I assume vessels sailed in configurations with lower tonnages.\n\n\n11.1.4 Masters’ total years at sea\nSince most voyages lack good duration data (see Simulated voyage day_in and/or year_in data above), and since duration of voyages varied over the decades (see Figure 3.11), where there is actual or estimated voyage duration for at least one of a master’s voyage, for Figure 5.6 I used the average of all that master’s voyages for each voyage, and summed the total for each master.\n\n\n11.1.5 Crew size\nI assume that any vessel with less than 12 crew has an incomplete crew list, and I excluded it from the plots in Section 6.1 Number of crew.\n\n\n11.1.6 Unique crew members\nThere is no unique identifier per person. The crewentry_id field in the crew lists is based on the crewlist_id, and the spellings and abbreviations of names were not always consistent. Thus its difficult to identify individual people who participated in multiple voyages. It is tractable problem to reduce the over-count in the 88 voyages that have two or three crew lists, since a voyage happens over a short time frame with a small set of the universe of crew members. I made an effort to remove duplicates in this case, however there are some remaining due to differences in the spellings individual first or last names. I did not spend the time to find and address these individual cases among the 164,506 crew records remaining.\n\n\n11.1.7 Crew skin color\n\n\n\nThe many clerks over many years recording skin color likely did not apply consistent definitions or spellings. I consolidated 207 unique skin descriptions (including misspellings) into four categories:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Crew skin color in consolidated categories\n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      skin\n      n_crew\n    \n  \n  \n    unknown\n78,780\n    white, light, fair\n43,381\n    negro, black, colored\n38,464\n    other\n3,881\n  \n  \n  \n\n\nFigure 11.1: High-level skin color categories\n\n\n\n\nIt’s likely my interpretation does not match the recording clerks’ interpretation in some cases. For example, in which category should I place “brown”? To illustrate the challenge, some of the logic used to classify is shown below. Note that any category with less than 3000 instances is placed in “other”.\n\ndf_crew_skin <- df_crew %>%\n  mutate(skin = str_to_lower(skin),\n         skin = case_when(\n           str_detect(skin, \"light|fair|fare|freck|white\")              ~ \"white, light, fair\",\n           str_detect(skin, \"black|blk|negro|colo|african|coulered|collourd|sable|dark|lite\")      \n                                                                        ~ \"negro, black, colored\",\n           skin == \"b\"                                                  ~ \"negro, black, colored\",\n           str_detect(skin, \"indian|swarthy|copper|tawny|brown|coffee|mixed|native\")    \n                                                                        ~ \"mulatto, swarthy, tawny, brown\",\n           str_detect(skin, \"tto|mullato|mulato|sepia|seppia|sambo\")    ~ \"mulatto, swarthy, tawny, brown\",\n           str_detect(skin, \"olive|portuguese|portguguese|portugues|portugese\")             \n                                                                        ~ \"olive, portuguese\",\n           str_detect(skin, \"yellow\")                                   ~ \"yellow, yellowish\",\n           str_detect(skin, \"ruddy|rudy|red\")                           ~ \"ruddy, red\",\n           is.na(skin)                                                  ~ \"unknown\",\n           TRUE                                                         ~ skin\n           ),\n         skin = fct_lump_min(skin, min = 3000, other_level = \"other\")\n         )"

Thus the revenue estimates per voyage and the combinations of products collected are necessarily understated.\n\n\n11.2.2 Accounting for product from ships that were lost\nThe voyages data set appears to include records for voyages in ships were lost or abandoned yet quantities of product (whale, sperm, bone) are recorded. It’s likely that as the masters took their logs with them but were not able to sell the product they collected. Thus in some cases revenue per voyage may be overstated.\n\n\n11.2.3 Product per day\nSome voyages appear to last only a few days, likely due to incorrect start or end dates for the voyage. The resulting product per day amounts are not credible. To partially adjust for this, I excluded voyages shorter than 7 days in Section 8.4.3 Normalized product yield.\n\n\n11.2.4 Inflation\nPrices for the Charles W. Morgan’s products come from Mystic Seaport Museum. As noted in Section 9.2 Charles W. Morgan I did not adjust for inflation except in Figure 9.3 Revenue for Charles W. Morgan’s product each voyage, because inflation was low during this period. This conclusion is based on estimates of CPI from the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis (“Consumer Price Index, 1800-” 2022-08-26):\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.2: Inflation based on estimated Consumer Price Index during the years of the Charles W.
