## My work life

*I work at IBM in the role of a Program Director / Principal Product Manager for software tools used by engineers and developers to create the amazingly complex product, systems and systems-of-systems our societies rely on, including planes, trains, automobiles, space vehicles, military systems, and IT systems that enable smooth operation of our financial sector and government services. I speak for myself on this website, except in the papers and presentations below.*

* *IBM Engineering (aka IBM Engineering Lifecycle Management) is the new name for the IBM Continuous Engineering Solution. With the new name comes a UI face lift and a strategic focus on insightful engineering at enterprise scale.*

[*Reyond Requirements Engineering: Solving the really hard problems in engineering and development*](./files/Solving-the-hard-problems-2019-03.pdf) by Daniel Moul. REConf 2019 conference. March 2019.

* *Requirements are only meaningful if they are defined and used within a development process – ideally one that guides teams to maximum impact and maximum efficiency. This statement has many implications for your development process and the many tools your developers and engineers use as they bring your development process to life. A foundational enabler is the ability to create a shared development context for your teams and evolving it in a controlled way: across multiple tools from multiple vendors, maintaining dependencies among the data in these tools, and with effective change management. This session will briefly survey ways this is typically addressed today with the various compromises that are inherent in these approaches, then explain the concepts and promise of “global configurations” in your engineering tool chain as enabled by OASIS OSLC Configuration Management and implemented by the IBM Continuous Engineering solution for software and systems engineering.*

[*Global configuration management: Vision, progress, possible directions*](./files/CM-05-Global-config-vision-progress-directions-2018-05.pdf) by Daniel Moul and Kathryn Fryer. Continuous Engineering Europe conference. May 2018.

* *Global configuration management promises a new level of simplicity and automation for teams developing complex systems who need to achieve higher levels of change control, reuse, with traceability across the development lifecycle, and at scale. Requirements, designs, tests, files and potentially other tools and their artifacts can participate in federated development streams and baselines. This session will (1) review the motivations for this OASIS OSLC initiative; (2) implementation progress in IBM tools, partner tools and client adoptions; and (3) offer some thoughts about future directions.*

[*What? You can do that now? A survey of what's new in the IBM Continuous Engineering Solution*](./files/DEP-09-What-You-Can-Do-That-Now-in-CE-2018-05.pdf) by Daniel Moul. Continuous Engineering Europe conference. May 2018.

* *Fasten your seat belts! In this single session you can get caught up on the significant new capabilities in the IBM solution delivered over the last year and in interim milestones since then (and planned for general availability this summer). We will look at what's new for requirements management, systems engineering, agile/lean development, quality management, software development, reporting, and the digital twin.*

[*Wow! Configuration management across teams and tools with IBM Rational Jazz*](./files/DCM-1877-Wow-CfgM-across-teams-and-tools-2015-02.pdf) by Daniel Moul and Nick Crossley. InterConnect 2015 conference. February 2015.

* *Today’s complex products and systems are mix of software, electronics, and hardware – with software taking an increasing role. The design and development of these complex systems requires many kinds of artifacts. Engineers in specialist disciplines produce these artifacts. Engineers practicing the various engineering disciplines use various tools. They come from multiple vendors. But these artifacts typically are not under Configuration Management, or if they are, it’s done with half-measures that incur trade-offs. These challenges exist for software-only systems, yet their magnitude is much greater for products with physical, electrical and software aspects. Tools build on open, flexible services and Internet architecture with cross-tool configuration management address many of the half-measures engineering teams implement today. Cross-tool, cross-domain uses cases are presented in diagrams, and global configuration management is introduced.*

[*The End of Cloning: Strategic Reuse and Product Line Engineering With the IBM Rational Platform*](./files/CEE-1905-The-End-of-Cloning-2014-06.pdf) by Daniel Moul and Barclay Brown. Innovate 2014 conference. June 2014.

* *In the beginning we made things all alike, or we made custom things for individual customers. Not customers demand increasingly specialized and customized products, and costs are going through the roof. Product Line Engineering practices implemented using an open, federated platform for PLE can address this challenge. We recommend the IBM solution for continuous engineering.*
    
[*Increasing productivity with requirements reuse and variant management with DOORS Next Generation*](./files/DRM-1946-Increasing-Productivity-with-Requirements-Reuse-and-Variant-Management-with-DOORS-Next-Generation-2014-06.pdf) by Eran Gery, Daniel Moul, and Brian Steele.

[*Drinking our own champagne: Rational Requirements Composer*](./files/RDM-1202A-Drinking-our-own-champagne-ibm-rational-rquirements-composer-2010-06.pdf) by Robin Bater and Daniel Moul. Innovate 2010 conference. June 2010.

* *This presentation illustrates how the Rational Requirements Composer product team used the Collaborative Application Lifecycle Management Jazz products to specify, analyze, design and implement a key feature of RRC version 2, and how we are using that feature in developing the next version. It will focus on use of RRC itself and include a discussion of benefits to the team. Plus (we hope): (1) Give you a vision of how IBM Rational® Requirements Composer (RRC) can improve team performance and project outcomes; (2) Show you a “real” usage model that is improving the product; (3) Get you thinking about how you and your teams can benefit from RRC.*

[*Faster Appplication Change and Reuse with WebSphere Studio Asset Analyzer*](./files/Faster-application-change-and-reuse-redp4225-2008.pdf) by Daniel Moul and Paul Hensler. IBM Redpaper. 2008.

* *Today’s enterprises could not exist without information technology. In fact, millions of lines of application code embody and enable business processes. These applications can be a source of competitive advantage as well as a brake on innovation. Existing systems have evolved over decades into massive sets of interrelated, complex combinations of computers, network equipment, middleware servers, storage systems, custom, and off-the-shelf software applications, as well as the data that these systems consume and generate. We examine the promise and the challenge of reuse and provide examples of using WebSphere Studio Asset Analyzer to cut through the complexity of application changes, with a focus on mainframe applications.*
