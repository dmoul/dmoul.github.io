<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> The lens</h1>
<p>Over the last 35 years technology has changed a lot, but some things don’t change: failures occur, we can learn from them, and that’s happening in the RISKS Forum.</p>
<p>During this time we experienced the rise of mobile phones, the internet, the ever-wider use of software in planes, automobiles–and it seems–everything else; web- and mobile-native companies; machine learning, and verbal interfaces to applications. All brought new opportunities and conveniences as well as new attack vectors and failure modes.</p>
<p>The Forum on Risks to the Public in Computers and Related Systems was started in 1985 as the comp.risks USENET newsgroup, sponsored by the Association for Computing Machines (<a href="https://www.acm.org">ACM</a>) until 2018, and has been moderated by <a href="http://www.csl.sri.com/users/neumann/neumann.html">Peter G. Neumann</a> since its inception. The archives are available at <a href="https://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/">RISKS Digest</a>, and new issues are available through email and newsfeed subscriptions. Its “front door” website is www.risks.org.</p>
<div id="hot-topics-and-perennial-favorites" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Hot topics and perennial favorites</h2>
<p>Some risks come and go: remember Y2K? Others including security and privacy seem fresh every year. One way to discover the ebb and flow of topics is to count the occurrences of words in the subject titles of submissions to the RISKS Forum. These titles are natural summaries of much longer text in the bodies of the submissions.</p>
<p>Part 1 of this analysis does that, looking at the 32 RISKS Forum volumes published between 1985-08-28 and 2020-11-13. The volumes include 34,652 submission titles in 2,838 issues. There are median 96 issues in a volume and median 11 subjects in an issue. Submissions include more than 3,542,410 words (156,712 in titles, 3,385,698 in the bodies of messages).</p>
<p>I parsed the volume summary pages, for example: <a href="https://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/29/index" class="uri">https://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/29/index</a>, using the popular text analysis library <code>spaCy</code> (using the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spacyr/vignettes/using_spacyr.html"><code>spacyr</code> wrapper</a> by Kenneth Benoit and Akitaka Matsuo) to covert words to their canonical form (“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemma_(morphology)">lemma</a>”). I use lemmas as one-word n-grams (a.k.a. “unigrams”), count their occurrence in certain time periods, and visualize the results below, making some observations along the way.</p>
<p>Note that the results are sensitive to data cleaning steps and various assumptions, including which words (including “risk”, “computer”, “software” and “system”) I consider too common and therefore filter out. See <a href="limitations-and-other-notes.html#limitations-and-other-notes">Limitations and other notes</a>.</p>

<div id="visualizations-and-discussion" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Visualizations and discussion</h2>
<p>Counting the frequency of unigrams in five-year periods and ranking them in each period makes visible some trends in Figure <a href="the-lens.html#fig:unigrams-all-plot2">1.1</a>. Unigrams that are ranked in the top five at least one year are red; unigrams are blue if their highest rank was six to ten at least one year.</p>
<p>Consistent topics over the years</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Security</em></strong> and <strong><em>privacy</em></strong> are always relevant. <strong><em>Voting</em></strong> keeps coming up: the security and trustworthiness of the voting process, computerized voting machines, and proposals for on-line voting.</li>
<li><strong><em>Hacker</em></strong> and <strong><em>hack</em></strong> are common too. Other sources of problems include <strong><em>error</em></strong>, <strong><em>failure</em></strong>, <strong><em>bug</em></strong>, <strong><em>crash</em></strong>, <strong><em>attack</em></strong>, <strong><em>breach</em></strong>, <strong><em>theft</em></strong>, and <strong><em>outage</em></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Changing topics</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Bank</em></strong>, credit <strong><em>card</em></strong>, the <strong><em>phone</em></strong> system, and computer <strong><em>virus</em></strong> topics gave way to mobile <strong><em>phone</em></strong>, the <strong><em>internet</em></strong>, on-line activities, <strong><em>cars</em></strong>, a direct focus on <strong><em>data</em></strong>, and <strong><em>fake news</em></strong>.</li>
<li><strong><em>Y2K</em></strong> came and went, as did lots of discussion of <strong><em>email</em></strong> and <strong><em>spam</em></strong>, and the security of <strong><em>Microsoft</em></strong> software. <strong><em>Microsoft</em></strong> was mentioned often 1995-2004; after that <strong><em>Google</em></strong>, <strong><em>Facebook</em></strong> and <strong><em>Apple</em></strong> make their appearance.</li>

</div>
<p><br></p>
<p>Now let’s zoom in and consider only 2010+. In Figure <a href="the-lens.html#fig:unigrams-all-plot3">1.2</a> we see <strong><em>security</em></strong>, <strong><em>internet</em></strong>, <strong><em>data</em></strong>, and <strong><em>car</em></strong> in the top five most years. At least one of <strong><em>hack</em></strong>, <strong><em>hacker</em></strong>, <strong><em>attack</em></strong> or <strong><em>NSA</em></strong> are usually in the top five. In the most recent years <strong><em>Facebook</em></strong> and <strong><em>Google</em></strong> are near the top, and <strong><em>Russian</em></strong> interference in the 2016 election was a common topic. Since 2017 <strong><em>AI</em></strong> is a common topic, and we find <strong><em>“fake_news”</em></strong> makes the ranking in 2017–after the 2016 US presidential election. (Turning “fake news” into the unigram “fake_news” is an intervention on my part to avoid losing visibility of this significant topic). Unsurprisingly, in 2020 <strong><em>Coronavirus</em></strong> and <strong><em>COVID-19</em></strong> top the list.</p>
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:unigrams-all-plot3"></span>
<p class="caption">
Figure 1.2: Unigram rank by frequency: five-year periods
</p>
<img src="09-risks-lens-main_files/figure-html/unigrams-all-plot3-1.png" alt="Unigram rank by frequency: five-year periods" width="100%" />
</div>
<p><br></p>
<p>Returning to five-year periods, we can see the relative frequency of the unigrams within and across these periods by plotting the portion of mentions during each period in Figure <a href="the-lens.html#fig:unigrams-all-plot4">1.3</a>.</p>
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:unigrams-all-plot4"></span>
<p class="caption">
Figure 1.3: Unigram frequency: five-year periods
</p>
<img src="09-risks-lens-main_files/figure-html/unigrams-all-plot4-1.png" alt="Unigram frequency: five-year periods" width="100%" />
</div>
<p><br></p>
<p>Which unigrams are most uniquely to be found in each period? We represent distinctiveness in terms of <a href="https://juliasilge.com/blog/introducing-tidylo/">weighted log odds</a>, which is the natural log of the odds of finding the unigram in one period compared to all the other periods. Figure <a href="the-lens.html#fig:unigrams-all-plot5">1.4</a> reinforces earlier observations of the changing topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>The focus on <strong><em>Y2K</em></strong> leading up to the big date as well as “year 2000”, converted here to <strong><em>year_2000</em></strong></li>
<li>The Strategic Defense Initiative <strong><em>(SDI)</em></strong> in the Reagan era</li>
<li>User interfaces <strong><em>CRT</em></strong> and <strong><em>VTD</em></strong> giving way to <strong><em>iphone</em></strong></li>
<li>The rise of <strong><em>Facebook</em></strong>, <strong><em>Google</em></strong>, <strong><em>Twitter</em></strong> and <strong><em>Tesla</em></strong></li>
<li>The decline of <strong><em>Compuserve</em></strong> and <strong><em>Netscape</em></strong></li>
<li>New software technologies and their implementation: concerns about <strong><em>ActiveX</em></strong> and <strong><em>Java</em></strong> were replaced by <strong><em>blockchain</em></strong>, <strong><em>bitcoin</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Android</em></strong>)</li>
</ul>
<p>We also see discussion of topics that were popular for a short time</p>
<ul>
<li>USS <strong><em>Vincennes</em></strong> shooting down an Iranian airliner</li>
<li><strong><em>Patriot</em></strong> missiles, <strong><em>Ariane</em></strong> rockets, and the <strong><em>Challenger</em></strong> disaster</li>
<li>Computer <strong><em>virus</em></strong> topics and specific malware, including <strong><em>klez</em></strong> and <strong><em>heartbleed</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:unigrams-all-plot5"></span>
<p class="caption">
Figure 1.4: Most unique unigrams: five-year periods
</p>
<img src="09-risks-lens-main_files/figure-html/unigrams-all-plot5-1.png" alt="Most unique unigrams: five-year periods" width="100%" />
</div>
<p><br></p>
<p>Which unigrams changed the most in number of mentions, either becoming more common or less common over the full period? I interpret the slope of linear regression lines as the magnitude of the trends in Figure <a href="the-lens.html#fig:unigrams-all-plot6">1.5</a>, sorting them from greatest increase to greatest decrease.</p>
<p>Linear regression lines under-represent recent large swings for topics including <strong><em>data</em></strong>, <strong><em>hack</em></strong> and <strong><em>car</em></strong> that have been around since the beginning.</p>

</div>
<p><br></p>
<p>Again we can zoom into 2010+ and this time look at the topics with biggest positive and negative trends in Figure <a href="the-lens.html#fig:unigrams-all-plot7">1.6</a>. Here <strong><em>AI</em></strong>, <strong><em>data</em></strong>, <strong><em>hacker</em></strong>, and <strong><em>security</em></strong> are among those terms growing the most in recent years while <strong><em>Snowdon</em></strong> and <strong><em>NSA</em></strong> show the steepest declines, representing both the significant discussion of the Snowden revelations in 2014-2015 and their fading after 2016.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Lessons from the RISKS Forum</h2>
<p>I’ve been reading the RISKS Forum for more than twenty years. Below are some of the lessons I have gathered during this time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your product is a system and is part of a larger system.</li>
<li>The application of any new technology occurs in the context of a system.</li>
<li>Design your systems to be resilient to failures.</li>
<li>When there is a catastrophic failure, it’s not uncommon that it occurred due to a series of lesser failures. During the design and testing phases of product development, the failure modes were not considered or it was not considered possible that they would occur at the same time. Or once in operation, lesser failures were allowed to fester, sometimes with the rationale “We have redundant systems.”</li>
<li>The weak link is often people, including their willingness or ability over the long term to follow rules and procedures and uphold the cultural norms necessary to maintain safe, reliable systems. People respond to their incentives, and managers’ incentives in particular seem too often to be at odds with maximizing safe and reliable operations, since they face pressures to limit costs and find new efficiencies.</li>
<li>People can be inattentive, distracted, confused, lazy, or malicious. You should take this into account in your designs.</li>
<li>Your design should guide people to the right things and require extra effort to do what may be the wrong things. Most people want to do the right things, and you may not have thought of all the “right things” they need to do.</li>
<li>When failures occur in or with systems that were not well designed, it’s common to blame the users.</li>
</ul>
