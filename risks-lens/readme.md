readme.md - accompanying "Risks through the lens of the RISKS Digest""

By Daniel Moul

Before running the analysis you need to download and prepare the data. See scripts/regen-risks-data.R.

These scripts will scrape the RISKS Digest web pages if they are not already cached and and create various .rds data files if they do not already exist. You will need more than 1GB of disk space (and an hour or more) to prepare the data. 

Then knit 09-risks-lens-main.Rmd.
