A growing number of companies are using Internet of Things technology to
create new medical treatments facilitated by connected, customized
devices. One example is the One Drop diabetes self-management system, which
combines sensors, an app, and a Bluetooth glucose meter to track and monitor
blood glucose levels, food, exercise, and medication. One Drop uses
artificial intelligence to predict a patient's blood glucose level over the
next 24 hours, and suggests strategies for controlling fluctuations. Other
new medical innovations range from implants to help paralysis victims walk
to smart pills that detect when patients fail to comply with their drug
regimens. Another emerging technology uses three-dimensional printers to
manufacture patient-tailored medical devices, such as knee joints and spinal
implants, based on the patient's magnetic resonance imaging and computed
tomography scans.

A big story here in the UK today is the House of Commons Digital, Culture,
Media and Sport Committee's report on Disinformation and `fake news' - see
for example:

<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/18/facebook-regulation-fake-news-mps-deepfake">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/18/facebook-regulation-fake-news-mps-deepfake</a>

However, these articles tend not to provide a link to the actual 109-page
report—which in fact is online at
<a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmcumeds/1791/1791.pdf">https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmcumeds/1791/1791.pdf</a>

This is the Final Report in an inquiry on disinformation that has spanned
over 18 months, covering individuals' rights over their privacy, how their
political choices might be affected and influenced by online information,
and interference in political elections both in this country and across the
world—carried out by malign forces intent on causing disruption and
confusion.

We have used the powers of the Committee system, by ordering people to give
evidence and by obtaining documents sealed in another country's legal
system. We invited democratically-elected representatives from eight
countries to join our Committee in the UK to create an `International Grand
Committee', the first of its kind, to promote further cross-border
co-operation in tackling the spread of disinformation, and its pernicious
ability to distort, to disrupt, and to destabilise.  Throughout this inquiry
we have benefitted from working with other parliaments.  This is continuing,
with further sessions planned in 2019. This has highlighted a worldwide
appetite for action to address issues similar to those that we have
identified in other jurisdictions.

This is the Final Report in our inquiry, but it will not be the final word.
We have always experienced propaganda and politically-aligned bias, which
purports to be news, but this activity has taken on new forms and has been
hugely magnified by information technology and the ubiquity of social media.
In this environment, people are able to accept and give credence to
information that reinforces their views, no matter how distorted or
inaccurate, while dismissing content with which they do not agree as `fake
news'.  This has a polarising effect and reduces the common ground on which
reasoned debate, based on objective facts, can take place. Much has been
said about the coarsening of public debate, but when these factors are
brought to bear directly in election campaigns then the very fabric of our
democracy is threatened.  [...]

In a daring move that placed his life in danger, the I.T. consultant
eventually gave the F.B.I. his system's secret encryption keys in 2011 after
he had moved the network's servers from Canada to the Netherlands during
what he told the cartel's leaders was a routine upgrade.

A Dutch article says that it's a BlackBerry system.
<a href="https://www.volkskrant.nl/nieuws-achtergrond/nederlandse-politie-tapte-anderhalf-jaar-lang-alle-communicatie-van-mexicaanse-drugsbaron-el-chapo-~bab33a30/">https://www.volkskrant.nl/nieuws-achtergrond/nederlandse-politie-tapte-anderhalf-jaar-lang-alle-communicatie-van-mexicaanse-drugsbaron-el-chapo-~bab33a30/</a>

El Chapo had his IT person install "...spyware called FlexiSPY on the
'special phones' he had given to his wife, Emma Coronel Aispuro, as well as
to two of his lovers, including one who was a former Mexican lawmaker." That
same software was used by the FBI when his IT person turned over the
keys. Yet again we learn the lesson that a backdoor can be used against you.

And it doesn't have to be with the IT person's permission. A good
intelligence agency can use the IT person's authorizations without his
knowledge or consent. This is why the NSA hunts sysadmins.

Moscow, Russia: The entire country of Russia is planning to temporarily
disconnect from the Internet as part of a test to gauge its cybersecurity
capabilities, with the long-range goal of keeping all internal web traffic
on its own servers and out of reach form foreign hackers. Russian news site
RBC reported that the move will analyze the country's preparedness for
legislation mandating a sovereign Internet. The stated goal of the
legislation is to protect Russia from cyber attacks from countries like the
U.S., “The project was developed taking into account the U.S. national
cybersecurity strategy adopted in 2018, which declares the principle of
`maintaining peace by force,'' and Russia, along with Iran and North Korea,
is accused of hacker attacks, RBC reported. The exercises are expected to
determine what amendments need to be made to the draft law and what costs.
will be required for its implementation.

Nick Bastone, Business Insider, 20 Feb 2019
Google: 'Nest' microphone was on 'double-secret probation'
<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nest-microphone-was-never-supposed-to-be-a-secret-2019-2">https://www.businessinsider.com/nest-microphone-was-never-supposed-to-be-a-secret-2019-2</a>

Google says the built-in microphone it never told Nest users about was
'never supposed to be a secret'

In early February, Google announced that its home security and alarm system
Nest Secure would be getting an update.  Users, the company said, could now
enable its virtual-assistant technology, Google Assistant.

The problem: Nest users didn't know a microphone existed on their security
device to begin with.  The existence of a microphone on the Nest Guard,
which is the alarm, keypad, and motion-sensor component in the Nest Secure
offering, was never disclosed in any of the product material for the device.

On Tuesday, a Google spokesperson told Business Insider the company had made
an `error'.  “The on-device microphone was never intended to be a secret
and should have been listed in the tech specs.  That was an error on our
part.  The microphone has never been on and is [activated only] when users
specifically enable the option.''

Google also said the microphone was originally included in the Nest Guard
for the possibility of adding new security features down the line, like the
ability to detect broken glass.

Still, even if Google included the microphone in its Nest Guard device for
future updates—like its Assistant integration—the news comes as
consumers have grown increasingly wary of major tech companies and their
commitment to consumer privacy.  For Google, the revelation is particularly
problematic and brings to mind previous privacy controversies, such as the
2010 incident in which the company acknowledged that its fleet of Street
View cars "accidentally" collected personal data transmitted over consumers'
unsecured WiFi networks, including emails.

If @Google's @Nest Secure devices really had secret microphones that they
hid from consumers, those consumers should probably be forgiven if they
don't trust the company's after-the-fact promises that it never spied on
them.

International Computer Science Institute researchers estimated that about
17,000 Android apps collect identifying information, creating a permanent
record of the activity on the owner's device. This practice apparently
violates Google's policy on collecting data that can be used for targeted
advertising. The apps track users by linking their Advertising ID number
with other identifiers on the phone that are hard or impossible to reset,
such as the phone's media access control address, International Mobile
Equipment Identity, and Android ID. Fewer than 33% of identifier-collecting
apps accept only the Advertising ID, as recommended by Google's best
developer practices. The researchers noted the apps have been installed on
at least 100 million devices. Google said it has investigated their
findings, and taken remedial action on certain apps.

A scientific coalition is urging a ban on the development of weapons
governed by artificial intelligence (AI), warning they may malfunction
unpredictably and kill innocent people. The coalition has established the
Campaign to Stop Killer Robots to lobby for an international accord. Said
Human Rights Watch's Mary Wareham, autonomous weapons "are beginning to
creep in. Drones are the obvious example, but there are also military
aircraft that take off, fly, and land on their own; robotic sentries that
can identify movement." Clearpath Robotics' Ryan Gariepy advocates for a
ban, and cautions that AI's abilities "are limited by image recognition.
It ... does not have the detail or context to be judge, jury, and executioner
on a battlefield." The New School in New York's Peter Asaro adds that
illegal killings by autonomous weaponry raise issues of liability, which
would likely make the weapon's creators accountable.

The premise seems to be that machine learning is causing irreproducible
results to be reported because the algorithms are finding patterns that
aren't there.  These algorithms are being used to mine large datasets that
have already been collected.  I think this concern may be misplaced.  The
actual problem may be relying too much on a _post_hoc_ analysis, though with
these datasets you often don't have a choice.  The worst example that comes
to mind is Lilly's Alzheimer's drug solanezumab.  After failing two Phase
III clinical trials, Lilly hired an outside data analysis firm to study the
data.  I don't know how they analyzed the data, but you don't need machine
learning to do a _post_hoc_ analysis.  They found an effect in a subgroup of
the dataset—subjects who had the very earliest symptoms.  So now, Lilly
is working on a third Phase III clinical trial, this time only with subjects
at the earliest detectable stage.  I can't recall any other drug that
actually had a third PIII trial, but Lilly has thrown so many billions into
this project that the glimmer of hope provided by the _post_hoc_ subgroup
analysis means they can't give up now.

'The "reproducibility crisis" in science refers to the alarming number of
research results that are not repeated when another group of scientists
tries the same experiment. It means that the initial results were wrong. One
analysis suggested that up to 85% of all biomedical research carried out in
the world is wasted effort.

'But, according to Dr Allen, the answers they come up with are likely to be
inaccurate or wrong because the software is identifying patterns that exist
only in that data set and not the real world.

'Often these studies are not found out to be inaccurate until there's
another real big dataset that someone applies these techniques to and says
'oh my goodness, the results of these two studies don't overlap',' she said.

A worrisome trend, given that dataset analysis may be applied to influence
regulatory approvals for new medical devices and pharmaceuticals. Other
industries and their outputs may also be subject to dataset bias that
erroneously attributes ready for sale or use.  Caveat emptor.

The following story is appalling. Why would anyone want to spend their lives
doing something so evil? At least people in the past, like those in the
Manhattan Project, understood they were in an ethical quandary and there
were some reasonable arguments for upsides in what they were doing. I can't
see any upsides to this. Why would they bother to do it at all?  Another
reason I left computer science and AI --- there seemed to be no appreciation
for the difference between machines and humans nor any thoughts for the
ethics of what they were doing. Evil is often done simply because nobody
thought about the results of their behavior, not just because they didn't
care. I'm not sure I would want to live in the world that is coming. We now

'OpenAI said its new natural language model, GPT-2, was trained to predict
the next word in a sample of 40 gigabytes of Internet text. The end result
was the system generating text that "adapts to the style and content of the
conditioning text," allowing the user to "generate realistic and coherent
continuations about a topic of their choosing."  The model is a vast
improvement on the first version by producing longer text with greater
coherence.

'But with every good application of the system, such as bots capable of
better dialog and better speech recognition, the non-profit found several
more, like generating fake news, impersonating people, or automating abusive

More details below, including samples of input and resulting output.  At
first I thought it was producing clever crap, but after reflection I see
this as a remarkable achievement.  It reminds me of Wernicke's aphasia, a
brain dysfunction that causes people to produce language in complete
sentences that are syntactically correct, but nonsense sometimes referred to
as a "word salad".  The text produced by the AI is not this incoherent by
any means.  It's defect is far more subtle, not seen in human language.  I'd
call it a "coherent idea salad".  Any human capable of producing language of
such syntactic quality and coherence would also have a clearer line of
thought.  But for a large part of what people use language for, this
technology may have already achieved what would satisfy many people.  Most
people are not writing a legal brief, technical manual, or patent
application where every word counts.  I would guess far more written
language is used for thank-you notes, letters describing my vacation,
complaints to Citibank, and other prose which is much more flexible with
regard to the thinking behind it.  A large number of people, perhaps a
majority, cannot compose even these more mundane writings.  For these
people, this software could greatly expand the reach of what they can
express.  We're still in the early days of this technology, and with a few
years of further development it could greatly change how people use
language.  It may be revolutionary.

OK, you've all heard about VFEmail.net.
<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2019/02/vfemail-cyber-attack.html">https://thehackernews.com/2019/02/vfemail-cyber-attack.html</a>
<a href="http://www.itpro.co.uk/security/32972/us-email-provider-wiped-out-by-hacker">http://www.itpro.co.uk/security/32972/us-email-provider-wiped-out-by-hacker</a>

The fact that no ransom was demanded is a possible indicator of "disgruntled
employee" along with the fact that the different servers had different
authentications.  Which brings me to my recommendation for ransomware and
many, many other forms of attack: backup.

Backup, backup, backup.

The oldest protection in the book, possibly the most effective, and the one
that everyone has (mostly invalid) reasons that they don't use.

Yes, I know the backup servers were formatted as well.  That just means you
use other forms of backup.

I've got an external drive that's semi-permanently attached and running a
Windows backup program. It's supposed to backup any changes every fifteen
minutes. I don't really trust it, but I've recovered stuff off it
occasionally. I don't really trust it because it's attached. Like in the
VFEmail case, I figure if I can get at it without plugging in cables, so can
the bad guys. I figure the same goes for other machines on the LAN or online
or cloud drives or storage systems. I do keep my "current" presentations on
Google Drive, just in case.

The one I really rely on is an old Passport drive. I have to plug it in to
make a backup. I do it sporadically, and probably not as frequently as I
should, but it's been surprisingly effective. That drive is, itself, backed
up on to external and non- connected laptops. (Well, at this point, laptop.
It's on the Windows laptop. It used to be on the Mac as well, but the Mac
had a corruption breakdown recently, and I replaced the drive. Since I keep
all my old drives [hey, I'm an old malware researcher, and I've got samples
and zoos all over the place, so just sending them to recycling would be a
bit irresponsible] then I guess it is still backed up on a very external
drive.)

I got a "credit card" USB drive at a show, recently, and I keep it in my
wallet. It's pig slow, so I don't do backups on it as much, but I do keep my
current presentations on it, and, at the moment as I writing this, I'm
backing up all my email onto it.

OK, this is all just to back up my own stuff, and I couldn't keep masses of
corporate data in my wallet.  (Although it's surprising how much of the most
important stuff you can put on there.)  But the point is the same: backups
can save your backside, and a little thought and imagination is more
important than million dollar contracts on remote hot sites.

A common tactic of authoritarian regimes is to make laws which are next to
impossible to abide by, then not enforce them.  This creates a culture where
it's perfectly acceptable to ignore such laws, yet the regime may use
selective enforcement to punish dissenters—since legally, everyone is
delinquent.

Now try to teach humorless AI to work in such an "everyone does it"
atmosphere...

As someone who unfortunately has a fair bit of experience in the system, I
notice two things in particular about dealing with doctors.

Firstly, speaking the same language is important - most of my bad
experiences have been with foreign doctors, no matter how good their
English.

And secondly, *experience counts*! Doctors, like the rest of us, make
mistakes when outside their comfort zone.

I remember an article from a computer mag in the 80s where a GP had written
a simple diagnostic program in, iirc, Logo or Prolog, which was easily
extensible as new patients with new illnesses and symptoms came in. And the
doctor said that many patients liked using it - it was easier to be honest
with it :-)

But from the doctor's point of view, it showed him the questions the program
had asked and the patient's responses, and which illnesses were ruled in/out
by those answers. The really crucial aid the program gave the doctor was
that it didn't forget, and quite often prompted the doctor to check out an
illness that wouldn't have crossed his mind without the program.

A Silicon-based Physician Assistant that can explain what conclusion it has
come to, and why, could be a massive help to a Carbon-based Physician,
especially a junior one gaining experience. Even if said explanation is
pretty simplistic.

These are all excellent points, all of which already exist to some extent
with current medical technology. Sadly though, in the U.S. at least, the
most important question might be:

  Who will get sued when something gives a wrong diagnosis or treatment?

It is sad that important life-saving technology is delayed and even denied
based on the fact that it's not "perfect" despite "perfection" not being
achievable. People will always be more suspicious of automation and
machinery than they are of other people. Witness the debates over
self-driving cars and the Trolley Problem.

Many families face this sort of problem, too - the standard security
advice never to share passwords is really inappropriate for these
situations.

Of course, if Waze is forbidden to post this info, other applications to do
that would pop up; even if the state somehow manages to block all of these,
groups on any messaging system or special sharable sites could do the same
(such sites had been used since before Waze existed).

They'd never learn.
