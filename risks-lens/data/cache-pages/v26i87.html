An anecdote on risks to patients when anti-virus software goes awry in
Health Information Technology (HIT).

"Our hospital fetal monitoring devices interface with our general HIT
system. We had found some viruses that were missed by our previous antivirus
software and we replaced it one month ago with a new product.  This morning
the new antivirus software identified the fetal monitor file as malware and
deleted it. We have not able to recover the lost file, which contains about
7 hours of fetal monitor data."

<a href="http://hosted.verticalresponse.com/250140/86af97f052/">http://hosted.verticalresponse.com/250140/86af97f052/</a>

Similar AV risks for HIT have been reported in the past.  An incident in
April 2010 caused an outage by an errant anti-virus DAT file update.
<a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126168997">http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126168997</a>

The risks?  Technical components for malware mitigation are not without
their own risks that manifest at the system level.  Malware mitigation has
obvious importance for software-based medical devices and HIT, but systems
engineering thinking needs to be front and center.

My interpretation: "Don't throw out the baby with the malware."  The
overarching goal should remain better outcomes for public health.  Thanks to
Ross Koppel at UPenn for bringing this anecdote to my attention.

Posts on social media raise risks of mistrial; state's judges told to
spell out rules

Milton J. Valencia, *The Boston Globe*, 14 May 2012

In the state's first decision involving juries and social media, the
Massachusetts Appeals Court has called on judges to better police jurors'
use of the Internet to make sure they do not discuss cases online, and thus
risk a mistrial.

The court said judges need to do more to explain to jurors that refraining
from conversations about a case also means not posting anything about it on
Facebook or Twitter, common practice in today's technology-driven world.

"Jurors must separate and insulate their jury service from their digital
lives,'' the court said in a ruling involving a Plymouth Superior Court case
in which several jurors made comments on Facebook during a trial. Those
posts in turn elicited responding posts from friends.

"Instructions not to talk or chat about the case should expressly extend to
electronic communications and social media,'' the court added in its
little-noticed ruling two weeks ago. ...

  "That could mean the Web might look drastically different in other
  countries than it does in the United States, opponents of the proposals
  say. An Internet user in Uzbekistan could be more easily tracked by
  government officials and might get access to only a portion of the Google
  search results seen in the United States, for example.  In a rare
  coordinated effort to knock down the proposals, Google, Microsoft, Verizon
  and Cisco also warn of financial risks to their businesses if new rules
  are adopted. They say some nations may push for laws on Internet firms
  that could lead to tariffs on Internet service providers such as Verizon,
  or even Web firms such as Facebook that enable people to communicate over
  the Internet.That could mean the Web might look drastically different in

Espionage software that was recently found targeting Iranian computers
contains advanced Bluetooth capabilities, taking malware to new heights by
allowing attackers to physically stalk their victims, new analysis from
Symantec shows.

The Flame malware, reported earlier this week to have infiltrated systems in
Iran and other Middle Eastern countries, is so comprehensive that security
experts have said it may take years for them to fully document its inner
workings. In a blog post published Thursday, Symantec researchers dangled an
intriguing morsel of information concerning one advanced feature when
picking apart a module that the binary code referred to as BeetleJuice.****
&lt;<a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/05/spy-malware-infecting-iranian-networks-is-engineering-marvel-to-behold/">http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/05/spy-malware-infecting-iranian-networks-is-engineering-marvel-to-behold/</a>&gt;
&lt;<a href="http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/flamer-recipe-bluetoothache">http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/flamer-recipe-bluetoothache</a>&gt;

The component scans for all Bluetooth devices in range and collects the
status and unique ID of each one found, presumably so that it can be
uploaded later to servers under the control of attackers, the Symantec
report said. It also embeds an encoded fingerprint into each infected device
with Bluetooth capabilities. The BeetleJuice module gives the attackers the
ability to track not only the physical location of the infected device, but
the coordinates of smartphones and other Bluetooth devices that have been in
range of the infected device.

Funny, but the DCS project that we did in 1970s under NSF funding used a
"content-centric" Local network and it yielded many important advantages.
Unfortunately the techniques used were eliminated by those who picked up

  Internet traffic that aims to provide greater security and faster
  connectivity.

  Content-centric networking represents a shift from today's focus on using
  network addresses to find content. Instead it proposes a protocol that
  specifically defines and tracks content. Backers say it represents an
  evolutionary change similar to IP forwarding.

  “We think it's definitely a concept that will change how people design

I had an interesting issue come up today.  One of our staff was complaining
that our web site wouldn't load.  After the usual "it works for me" dance we
took a look at his computer and found his browser had a cached copy of our
home page containing requests for two javascript files not present on the
original.

What happened is he flew on SouthWest airlines yesterday and their in flight
wifi injected the scripts into the page which was then cached by the browser
(they also manipulated the page cache headers to make the content cacheable
far longer than intended).  When he tried to load the page on our network
the server addresses for the scripts were not reachable so the browser
appeared to hang until the connection timed out.

The issues here are legion. Start with the fact that our site appeared to be
broken, had this been a customer rather than an employee we'd probably have
lost them.  Then move on to cache time manipulation which could lead to
users seeing and making decisions based on stale content with potentially
negative consequences.  Finally the fact that the cached content was
attempting to load unauthorized scripts while it was running on our our
intranet poses some interesting security questions.

Needless to say out employees are now banned from using SouthWest inflight
wifi.

According to Katy McCaffrey, she was on a cruise when her iPhone was stolen.
But she had set it up so that photos taken with it would be automatically
transmitted to her own computer.  It didn't take long after that for a
suspect to be identified as a cruise line employee, and the phone to be
recovered.

While the sleuthing is impressive - there have been a number of these - I'm
curious if there are ethical or legal issues. Being able to tap into your
own property makes perfect sense, but in a way also resembles wiretap and
hacking into computer systems. For example. if the stolen property were
transferred to a good-faith purchaser who then made proprietary business or,
er, explicit marital videos which the theft victim in turn publicized on the
web—well, I think there are some privacy boundaries to ponder, even with
an underlying illegality and righteous pursuit of justice.

On Valentine's Day, Nick Bergus came across a link to an odd product on
Amazon.com: a 55-gallon barrel of ... personal lubricant.  He found it
irresistibly funny and, as one does in this age of instant sharing, he
posted the link on Facebook, adding a comment: "For Valentine's Day. And
every day. For the rest of your life."

Within days, friends of Mr. Bergus started seeing his post among the ads on
Facebook pages, with his name and smiling mug shot. Facebook - or rather,
one of its algorithms - had seen his post as an endorsement and transformed
it into an advertisement, paid for by Amazon.  ...

Alina Tugend, *The New York Times*, 1 Jun 2012

Sometimes I just don't know when a column is going to hit a nerve.  But
judging from the response to my May 19 piece, annoying telemarketing calls
and robo-calls rank high among the miserable irritants of everyday life.

Readers said the calls, particularly those that offer lower interest rates
for credit cards and mortgages, are becoming more frequent, despite using
every tool available to block them.

Reporting such calls to the Federal Trade Commission, as I suggested, was an
exercise in frustration and futility, many readers told me.

"I have all four of my phone numbers on the Do Not Call Registry," one
reader, John Dingman, of Dallas, told me in an e-mail. "When I report such
calls, the F.T.C. site thanks me and there is no other discernible
response. The calls continue, perhaps from other companies, perhaps from the
same companies with a new gambit and/or phone number. Who knows?"

Readers told me that the Do Not Call Registry seemed to work just fine at
blocking calls when it began in 2003 and for several years after that. But
the number of unwanted calls has steadily increased. ...

Siri has been on my "list of things to avoid" pretty much from before I
obtained the new iPhone.

Although I generally like the phone, there are some features that I
disabled/changed the moment I received it.  Siri is part of those features
that are killed - here is the complete list:

1- iCloud.  No thank you.  I have a legal obligation (and, more importantly,
an ethical one) to protect the privacy of my clients and friends, so I will
not give an uncontrolled 3rd party access to their data..

2 - Location services: only enabled for apps that really have a need for it,
which excludes most weather programs (the risk of data leaks is high).
There is an interesting gotcha here: without the "find my phone" location
service enabled you will not have a remote kill switch for the phone - even
if you don't want to locate it first.  Let me translate that: a
knowledgeable thief or less than honest finder just has to disable location
services to prevent remote kill.  Not good - should be a separate, protected
function (assuming the theft was for the hardware rather than the content).

3 - Simple passwords - I opted for complex ones (or at least longer ones).
Needs no elaboration :).

4 - Siri.  An iPhone doesn't have the local power to process voice commands,
so it sends them to a US hosted service.  In the process it thus provides
pristine, digital quality voice prints of clearly identifiable users to an
untrusted 3rd party. Biometrics are biometrics, whatever form they take..

5 - iMessage, the Apple version of WhatsApp.  iMessage and WhatsApp give
providers access to all user messages, especially since they also carry
images.  While I'm on WhatsApp - it also exports the *entire* address book
to WhatsApp's servers (the iPhone version will not even permit access to
*configuration* until it has received permission to run off with that data).
Personally, I am in awe of these services.  I have never seen a global
intercept implemented so smoothly and inexpensively, ever..

Regarding the "end of the world" rhetoric about the spent fuel pool at
Fukushima reactor #4, this nonsense has been thoroughly debunked by a
special post at the blog of the American Nuclear Society.

<a href="http://ansnuclearcafe.org/2012/05/16/spent-fuel-at-fukushima-not-dangerous/">http://ansnuclearcafe.org/2012/05/16/spent-fuel-at-fukushima-not-dangerous/</a>

For starters, critics claim there are 10,893 spent fuel assemblies at
Fukushima. In fact, there are only 2,724 spent fuel assemblies and all of
them are in conditions which are below the temperature at which fuel
cladding could oxidize. The technical details are laid out in the ANS Cafe
article.

Then there are claims, in particular, that if the spent fuel in pool #4 were
to lose its cooling water, that the zirconium cladding on the fuel would
oxidize and that all of the curies of radioactivity in the fuel would
simultaneously be ejected into the open air.

This sequence isn't possible based on the current condition of the spent
fuel at reactor #4 nor is it possible for the other spent fuel stored at
Fukushima.

First, the spent fuel isn't hot enough. It has been out of the reactor long
enough that even if all the water was lost, the remaining decay heat would
still be below the point of ignition which is 900C for the cladding and
2,880C for the uranium oxide in the fuel.

Second, the fuel has been out of the reactor for more than a year. The fuel
has been out of the reactor longer than the point at which it could catch on
fire.

Scare the socks off people propaganda is never a substitute for engineering
reality. You might just as well try to build railroads on snow drifts.

Indeed, but I feel that it also applies the other way round, i.e.,
authorities are using the Internet to monitor what we're up to and taking
action against unacceptable behaviour, under the pretext of maintaining law
and order, of course.  The audit trail left by digital communications
enables anything that you say (or write) to be taken down and used in
evidence against you later.  And apart from CCTV, in public places there's
usually someone nearby with a smartphone incorporating a movie camera to
catch any lapses (and maybe post them on YouTube).

Comment from a Brit: yes, it's irritating how the authorities make a big
fuss about "don't worry, we won't read your e-mails or record your telephone
conversations, we just want access to traffic records (which ISPs and phone
companies keep anyway), so no threat to your privacy or anything..." while
as RISKS readers will know, details of who you're communicating with are
hugely revealing, and if this is available in real time then your movements
can be tracked as well.

Usual justification is "we need to do this, or you'll be blown up by
terrorists!"  Yeah, right...
