<i>Tue, 5 Mar 1996 11:54:33 +0100</i>
<p>I talked with Alan Pollock at the National Transportation Safety Board in Washington DC on March 4. The investigation is being conducted by Dominican Republic with `full participation' of the US NTSB. The Dominican Republic civil aviation authorities
asked the NTSB to make available some information after a preliminary review of the Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) and Flight Data Recorder (FDR) information.</p>
<p>[Summary of official information]</p>
<p>The CVR and FDR were taken to the NTSB on February 28th. A preliminary review was conducted on February 29th. The quality of the data was good. The crew discussed airspeed indications early during the takeoff roll and after takeoff. While climbing
through 7300ft, the stick shaker sound was heard, the aircraft started to descend and the stick shaker sound continued for about 84 seconds until the end of recorded data. Recorded airspeed at stick shaker activation was 335kts. Ground-based radar and
other FDR data indicated a much lower airspeed. The data are consistent with proper functioning of flight controls, engines and thrust reversers. There is no evidence of any unusual weather event or external forces on the aircraft. Investigation is
continuing.</p>
<p>[end of summary]</p>
<p>The `stick shaker' is a device which `shakes' the control stick when lift begins to degrade to let the pilots know of an impending aerodynamic stall. It really gets your attention, quickly, not to speak of raising the adrenaline level.</p>
<p>Courtesy of Robert Dorsett, I understand there are three independent airspeed indication systems in the B757: two electronic and one mechanical backup. It's unlikely in the extreme that all three were faulty. Pilots are trained to deal with faulty
information (I've had an airspeed indicator fail, I had only one system, I'm not a professional pilot). Since controls were functioning normally and there was no indication of outside disturbance, I would think it's likely that there was no relevant
airfoil contamination or misfunction. One could further conclude from this that the recorded 335 knots is likely not the actual airspeed at time of stick shaker activation.</p>
<p>This raises two issues which will presumably be addressed by further inquiry. First, why did airspeed drop: is it because the pilots appeared to be following faulty airspeed information; if so, why were they doing so? Second, was recovery initiated by
the pilots at stick-shaker activation: if not, why not; if so, was 7300ft altitude sufficient to recover in the actual situation, or did other factors inhibit recovery? Answers to these questions will probably lead to other questions.</p>
<p>The full text of the February 7 FAA press release and the March 1 Dominican Republic Factual Information from the NTSB is contained in my compendium `Computer-Related Incidents and Accidents with Commercial Airplanes' at<br><a href="http://www.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/~ladkin/">http://www.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/~ladkin/</a><br>

<p>I have made the claim that the nature of Internet opens it to various forms of deliberate damage and also to inevitable processes of decay and stale information. These latter two issues are important because anything that increases the amount of bad,
stale data in the system tends to provide incentives for more robotic programs and automated mechanisms for use in screening. These devices have their own problems, in particular their ability to generate large volumes of traffic which then become loads
on the system and problems for human operators to sort out. When ill-intentioned people are added to the mixture, it is possible to have really unpleasant things happen. PGN's lead item in <a href="/Risks/17/83">RISKS-17.83</a> is a case in
point.</p>
<p>The value of access to a data channel is partly a function of the signal to noise ratio of the data channel. As the S/N falls there are incentives to use more sophisticated filters to extract signal from noise. In analog systems these noise filters
have well defined, if often undesirable, characteristics. In the digital realm, the behavior is more difficult to characterize, especially when the filter design is closely matched to expected nature of the signal being filtered.</p>
<p>The growing use of these filters necessarily marks the Internet as a thermodynamically inefficient process: it is always less efficient to filter after the fact than it is to clean the signal before. (The problem, of course, is that those who bear the
cost of filtering at the tail end are not those who would bear the cost of producing a really clean signal at the front end!)</p>
<p>Of course, the net has been successful to date largely because the information placed there has been of known quality and those involved with the network have been restrained by storage limits, the originating group's culture, etc. In this way there
has been a historically high S/N, which makes searches and conversations relatively low effort and high yield.</p>
<p>The English economist Gresham's name is attached to a "law" of monetary systems that says "Bad money pushes good money out of circulation." Bad money refers to paper currency, which is easily debased by printing more. Good money refers to coin minted
from precious metals, the value of which remains relatively constant. When paper currency is debased, people tend to hoard their coin and the paper circulates, hence the law.</p>
<p>I modestly propose Cook's law (named after my Mother) which is "Bad data drives good data out of circulation." Here the bad data is the easily collected, easily stored, largely meaningless collections of characters that we see in so many areas (e.g.
medical records) that are making the value of effortful contributions (e.g. thoughtful summaries of the relevant details of a patient's clinical history and current state) hard to find. I claim that they are hard to find in part because the other things
in the chart constitute a form of noise that makes extracting the signal hard, and in part because the value (and incentive) for creating them is largely lost in the blizzard of other material. Interestingly, the electronic medical record has been
accompanied, in many places, by an underground paper system that isolates relevant information from the electronic data in ways that make it easy to generate and retreive, at least in the context of daily activity. We see this especially in the ICU and
operating room where informal records are made on slips of paper, pieces of adhesive tape, etc.</p>
<p>As the electronic medical record accumulates more data there will be a major effort to raise the S/N level via information filters not unlike the robotic devices now being developed to cope with the falling signal and rising noise levels of the
Internet. Humans will attempt to isolate high signal-low noise areas by using manual paper methods and hoarding the paper and by constructing within the electronic environment, vaults with access that is economically or organizationally restricted to
those with incentives to maintain high S/N.</p>

<p>As a Macintosh user and Netscape user, I've been waiting anxiously for an implementation of Java for the Mac. Netscape finally released their beta 1 version of their browser with Java implementation about ten days ago, and like all fans of
bleeding-edge technology, I downloaded my copy the moment I heard about it. There are many problems that can be attributed to such an early version of the program, I noticed one particularly grievous oversight: the lack of a provision to turn Java
downloading off.</p>
<p>Volunteer Beta testers have to be willing to deal with many problems, but being unable to evade such a well-documented and easily avoidable security risk shouldn't be one of them. I hope this is a problem that Netscape fixes in their next beta
release.</p>

<p>Netscape and possibly other (future?) Java-enabled browsers do not allow for system-wide defaults. They should allow for System Administrators to not only set defaults for users, but to also override user preferences. This would allow the Administrator
for a system to disable (for example) Java or JavaScript system wide.</p>
<p>The risks in not having such an option?</p>
<p>Assuming Java is bullet-proof.</p>
<p>Java is the type of program that has potential security holes in it as it allows someone to run programs on a machine they do not necessarily have any real access to. It is well designed to reduce the risks, but like any new program, there are bound to
be bugs.</p>
<p>Patches are nice, but there is no way to insure that everyone would be running the new version. If the browser allowed preferences based on version number, one could disable Java for buggy versions, but allow it for patched versions.</p>

<p>Topic: Java Implementations Can Allow Connections to an Arbitrary Host</p>
<p>The CERT Coordination Center has received reports of a vulnerability in implementations of the Java Applet Security Manager. This vulnerability is present in the Netscape Navigator 2.0 Java implementation and in Release 1.0 of the Java Developer's Kit
from Sun Microsystems, Inc. These implementations do not correctly implement the policy that an applet may connect only to the host from which the applet was loaded.</p>
<p>The CERT Coordination Center recommends installing patches from the vendors, and using the workaround described in Section III until patches can be installed.</p>
<p>As we receive additional information relating to this advisory, we will place it in<br><a href="ftp://info.cert.org/pub/cert_advisories/CA-96.05.README">ftp://info.cert.org/pub/cert_advisories/CA-96.05.README</a></p>
<p>We encourage you to check our README files regularly for updates on advisories that relate to your site.</p>
<p>I. Description</p>
<p>There is a serious security problem with the Netscape Navigator 2.0 Java implementation. The vulnerability is also present in the Java Developer's Kit 1.0 from Sun Microsystems, Inc. The restriction allowing an applet to connect only to the host from
which it was loaded is not properly enforced. This vulnerability, combined with the subversion of the DNS system, allows an applet to open a connection to an arbitrary host on the Internet.</p>
<p>In these Java implementations, the Applet Security Manager allows an applet to connect to any of the IP addresses associated with the name of the computer from which it came. This is a weaker policy than the stated policy and leads to the vulnerability
described herein. [...]</p>
<p>If you believe that your system has been compromised, contact the CERT Coordination Center or your representative in the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST). [...]</p>

<i>Tue, 5 Mar 1996 09:49:24 -0500</i>
<p>Following the suicide bombing in Tel-Aviv, Israel yesterday, the local telephone exchange was reported to have "collapsed" due to overload. In the report I heard, "collapse" was not defined.</p>
<p>To better understand this, it is helpful to know that Israelis are acutely aware of goings-on. Israelis are major users of cellular telephones; terrorist attacks are reported nation-wide literally within minutes.</p>
<p>I was in Jerusalem last week, very near 2 terrorist attacks. After the first, friends and relatives called from out of town, recognizing that I was nearby, to inquire if all was well. The following day, I went into town, boarding the bus exactly when
another terrorist attack occured at a nearby intersection. As usual, it was reported on the radio within minutes, while I was still on the bus. I got off two stops later and used a public pay phone to call my home-base, to notify them that I was OK.</p>
<p>I'm not a telephony expert, but with such `social conventions', it is conceivable that a major telephone exchange can collapse by overloading.</p>

<p>&gt; Excel version 5.0 on the PC does work for 2/29</p>
<p>This is true. And Excel version 5.0 knows that the year 2000 is indeed a leap year (see <a href="/Risks/17/83">RISKS-17.83</a>). It is very clever. Actually, it also "knows" that the year 1900 was a leap year. But it wasn't...</p>
<p>The program also doesn't appear to handle dates that are not in the 1900's or 2000's, so I couldn't check 2/29/1800 or 2/29/2100 or 2/29/2400. Of course,<br>

<p>In each version of Excel that I've examined, the 60th day of the calendar is 29 Feb 1900. Set a cell's format to "date" and type in 60 to see for yourself. This means, of course, that computations such as "number of days between x and y" where one or
the other date is in early 1900 will be wrong. Fixing the bug is also RISKy because that would change the date interpretation of all ordinal dates greater than 59, in turn making every existing spreadsheet involving a date compute or display something
unintended. Thought experiment: would YOU fix this bug if Excel were your product? How?</p>

<p>A similar situation happened to me. A heavily time-dependent system I wrote and maintain utilizes a code-file library to translate between Universal Time and the user's local time, in this case, Eastern Australia Summer Time. A problem reported by my
customer originated in the code-file library. The person who supports the code-file library diagnosed a bug that is triggered by the switch from Summer (Daylight Savings) time to standard time.</p>
<p>"But that switch isn't supposed to happen until the end of March!" True, but *last* year, it happened at the *beginning* of March, and the code-file library had not been bounced since the new parameter file, containing this year's switch date was put
into place, so it still thought the switch was on 3rd March.</p>
<p>I suspect a similar situation is what caused Steve's glitch. The risk, it seems to me, is in allowing local governments to futz around with the switch dates on a whim, rather than setting a firm rule for when to switch. On the other hand, the risk may
be that users expect computers (or software, or programmers) to be able to predict with any accuracy, what various governing bodies' decisions will be, long before those bodies even consider the question.</p>

<p>As an Australian living in the US I can relate to Windows 95's woes. I have an Australian calendar sent to me each year so I can keep track of local holidays and events such as these.</p>
<p>My calendar said that the changeover would be at March 3. When I last phoned home, I checked and found that the calendar was wrong. The calendar happens to be the Australian printing of the Far Side Desk Calendar.</p>
<p>This raises one RISK and one amusing possibility:</p>
<p>Risk: The information used was incorrect in the first place and is relied upon by numerous sources. The validation was done and performed correctly on this wrong information. (GIGO).</p>
<p>Amusing Possibility: Microsoft uses a Far Side calendar for their research.</p>
<p>I also hope that the Australian product support for Microsoft realised what the problem was early enough to help people. But from the sounds of it the detection was not early enough to provide a patch.</p>

<i>Tue, 5 Mar 1996 12:11:39 +0000</i>
<p>About 25 years ago, I found a remarkable bug in the "midnight routine" of a program designed to run continuously 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</p>
<p>In the New Year's night of any leap year, this routine stored the value 29 for February in the table of month lengths (located in the main memory). The bug: this variable was calculated two months before it was actually used; if the program would have
to be restarted (for any reason) within January or February of a leap year, the length of February would have been reset to its initial value, viz. 28, and the program would have produced garbage, on 29th February.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this particular bug did not go into the production version of the program; otherwise it could have remained undetected for several years.</p>
<p>The RISKs?</p>
<ul>
<li>In a program that runs for long periods, the restart behaviour has to be taken into consideration; you cannot assume that variables will last forever (i.e., beyond restart), if you don't specifically address this issue, in your program design.</li>
<li>Design, or programming, errors relating to calendrical calculations (or other issues involving long time spans) may go undetected for long times, until it may have become rather expensive to correct them. (One example of this rule are the year-2000
problems, discussed here recently.)</li>

<blockquote><i>[Omitted discussion duplicating some of <a href="/Risks/17/83">RISKS-17.83</a>, but based on year = 365.2422 days.]</i></blockquote>
A 365 day year comes out .2422 days short. Every four years, this is 4(.2422) = .9688 days short, so an extra day is added. However, that means<br>
that every four years is .0312 days too long. Each 99 year period is therefore 24(.0312) - 3(.2422) = .0222 days too long. By omitting the leap day every 100th year, that period becomes .2422 - .0222 = .22 days too short. After 400 years, that adds up to
4(.22) = .88 days too short, so an extra day is added to make it .12 days too long. I don't know when or if another correction occurs. If so, it is probably after 4,000 years, bringing the period from 1.2 days long to .2 days short.

<p>&lt;&gt; [...] the length of the tropical year is 365.24219 days. ...</p>
<p>I suggest:</p>
<ul>
<li>years divisible by 2000 _are_not_ leap years except</li>
<li>years divisible by 4000 _are_ leap years except</li>
<li>years divisible by 16000 _are_not_ leap years except</li>
<li>years divisible by 400000 _are_ leap years.</li>
</ul>
This yields an average length-of-year as given above (365.24219 days, which has an implied accuracy of ~0.4 seconds). While keeping to multiples of four, hundred and 400, it would have the undesirable side effect of turning 2000 into a not-leap-year...and
by the time the year 400000 comes around, the length of the day will be longer anyway.

<p>For posterity, here is (correct!) C code to compute whether "y" is a leap year or not. As PGN notes, this will have to change sometime probably in the next 10,000 years to account for the 3 day/10,000 year discrepancy. I don't have a reference for
this, but I did do copious literature checking a few years ago when I was frothing at the mouth about this subject. I suppose you could count me as an expert because, (a) I'm an astronomer, and (b) I worked at a Planetarium and this was one of the
relatively common questions asked, that our staff needed to know the correct answer to.</p>
<p>The more understandable version of the code comes first. Note that it is easiest to start with the *longest* periodicity, i.e., the 400 year one, and then move down to the smaller period cases. This ensures the longest period ones don't get lost in the
"if it's mod 4" case.</p>

enum _boolEnum { false=0, true=1};</code></p>

if(y % 100 == 0) return false;<br>
if(y % 4 == 0) return true;<br>
return false;</code></dd>
</dl>
<code>}</code>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The more compact macro version is:</p>
<dl>
<dd><code>#define ISLEAPYEAR(y) ((y) % 400 == 0 || ((y) % 100 != 0 &amp;&amp; (y) % 4 == 0))</code></dd>
</dl>
<p>Finally, note that if you are really lazy and willing to put off your buggy software for another 100 years, since 2000 is a leap year, then you can use</p>
<dl>
<dd><code>#define CHEAP_LEAP(y) ((y) % 4 == 0) /* fix before 29 Feb, 2100 */</code></dd>
