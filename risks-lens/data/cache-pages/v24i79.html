More than 20,000 international passengers were stranded for hours at Los
Angeles International Airport on Saturday, 11 Aug 2007, waiting on airplanes
and in packed customs halls while the malfunctioning of a computer system
that determined who would be subject to secondary searches prevented
officials from processing travelers entering the U.S.  The system was down
from 2pm until just after midnight, and the final passengers were not
cleared until 3:50am — except for six more requiring human intervention.
As of 3am, some parking lots were still gridlocked.

"This is probably one of the worst days we've had.  I've been with the
agency for 30 years and I've never seen the system go down and stay down for
as long as it did," said Peter Gordon, acting port director for customs.

According to the *Los Angeles Times* (and an Associated Press article), the
issue that caused thousands of travelers to be delayed at LAX was caused by
a faulty network interface card (NIC) on a single machine:

&gt; The card, which allows computers to connect to a local area network,
&gt; experienced a partial failure that started about 12:50 p.m. Saturday,
&gt; slowing down the system, said Jennifer Connors, a chief in the office of
&gt; field operations for the Customs and Border Protection agency.
&gt;
&gt; As data overloaded the system, a domino effect occurred with other
&gt; computer network cards, eventually causing a total system failure a
&gt; little after 2 p.m., Connors said.

<a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-me-lax15aug15,1,6802259.story?coll=la-headlines-nation">http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-me-lax15aug15,1,6802259.story?coll=la-headlines-nation</a>

I've noticed on more than one occasion that often when the primary system
breaks, and then fail-over occurs, the secondary system can't handle the
backlog of requests.

When setting up new systems, two identically configured units are usually
ordered and configured.  Perhaps the secondary units should be more powerful
as standard practice?  Or the two should always run in parallel/round-robin?
This way you know things are working on both, and if one goes away the
second one is still around (in a known working state).

H.R. 2272: the "21st Century Competitiveness Act of 2007" has been signed
into law:

  <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-2272">http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-2272</a>

One of its provisions has changed the legal basis of U.S. timekeeping from
mean solar time to UTC (Coordinated Universal Time).  UTC (in its current
form) has existed since the early 1970s, relying on the issuance of leap
seconds every year or two to remain within 0.9 SI seconds of Greenwich Mean
Time.  Thus, if leap seconds continue, the effect of changing from mean
solar time to UTC (overlaid by the standard time zones and varying Daylight
Saving Time rules) is small for most purposes.

However, since 1999, (feed://www.mail-archive.com/leapsecs@leapsecond.com)
the LEAPSECS forum has existed precisely to discuss the proposed elimination
of leap seconds — and thus the divergence of all civil and legal clocks
from time as kept by the sun in the sky.  With the passage of H.R. 2272, the
decision now rests not with the U.S. Congress, but with Working Party 7A of
the Radiocommunication Sector of the International Telecommunication Union
(ITU-R WP-7A):

  <a href="http://www.itu.int/pub/R-QUE-SG07.236">http://www.itu.int/pub/R-QUE-SG07.236</a>

Much of the LEAPSECS discussion has revolved around the large Y2K-like
resource drain that the international astronomical community would face
should UTC be redefined so as to no longer track mean solar time — not only
data structures would change, but also algorithms and runtime services.  Now
that UTC is legal time for the U.S., one wonders what similar expenses other
sectors would face.

It is straightforward to show that civil timekeeping must track mean solar
time closely:

1) Time kept by Mother Earth (mean solar time) differs from that kept by
   atomic clocks due to slowing caused by lunar tides.  (There are many
   other periodic and aperiodic effects, but the tidal transfer of angular
   momentum accumulates secularly over long periods.)

2) Leap seconds are issued to compensate for the accumulation of a few
   milliseconds per day due to slowing that has already occurred, i.e.,
   2ms/day times 500 days would be one leap second even in the absence of
   further tidal effects.  The solar day itself lengthens by just a few SI
   milliseconds per century.

3) With no leap seconds, day would literally turn into night over a few
   thousand years - i.e., this would be a redefinition of the much more
   fundamental concept of a "day".

4) There is a notion of embargoing leap seconds 3600 at a time into leap
   hours as a kind of unfunded mandate placed on our N-great grandchildren.
   Even those parties agitating for the cessation of leap seconds agree that
   eventually they must still be released in such a larger jump.

5) A larger jump would be more disruptive than a smaller jump, therefore it
   cannot be tolerated as frequently.

6) Pick a period of time over which a jump of such an amplitude would be
   deemed too frequent.  I suspect we could agree that one per century is
   too many, but for the sake of argument let's specify the looser
   constraint of a maximum of one leap hour per decade.

7) Simply divide.  One hour per ten years = 3600 SI seconds per 3652 days.

QED.  Civil time must track mean solar time to better than one SI second per
day.  (In actuality, much better than one second.)

The fundamental challenge for precision timekeeping is that there are two
flavors of time: 1) the steady cadence of atomic clocks, and 2) the
wondering orientation of the Earth in space.  A "second" is a unit with two
definitions that are often conflated.  A second is either 1/86400 of a day,
or a second is the SI unit.  In fact, the name first proposed for the SI
unit was the "essen", after Louis Essen, a pioneer timekeeper.  Much
confusion would have been saved if only this name had been chosen.

Q: What about apparent versus mean solar time?
A: A red herring.  The Earth spins very regularly with respect to the stars.
   Mean solar time is simply sidereal time offset by a little under four
   minutes daily to account for the day "lost" each year from lapping the
   Sun.  That sundials run fast or slow at different times of year has
   nothing to do with our clocks.  People do care, however, whether the sun
   is up at midnight in populated latitudes.

Q: Surely there have been professional meetings on this topic?
A: Yes, Torino in 2003. (<a href="http://www.gfy.ku.dk/~iag/ecag05doc/torino_coll.pdf">http://www.gfy.ku.dk/~iag/ecag05doc/torino_coll.pdf</a>)
   The consensus was to leave UTC alone and that any civil timescale without
   leap seconds should be called "TI" (International Time in the French
   acronym).  The ITU appears to have rejected this position.

Q: What's happened recently?
A: NASA has proposed a fall back recommendation making GPS time (with no
   leap seconds) a standard interval time scale for precision timekeeping
   projects, while leaving UTC alone:

<a href="http://ussg7.org/documents/fact%20sheet%20modified%20and%20proposed%20new%20Recommendation.doc">http://ussg7.org/documents/fact%20sheet%20modified%20and%20proposed%20new%20Recommendation.doc</a>

(This writer supports this recommendation.)

My apologies for the length of this Risks submission.  Confusion is often
rife in even simple timekeeping applications.

This is like the voting-machine thing: citizen concern over what's inside
the boxes we live with.

An attorney for a Minnesota man accused of drunken driving says he doesn't
think the manufacturer of a breathalyzer will meet a court-imposed deadline
of August 17 to turn over its source code.

If that happens, his client could go free.

As CNET News.com reported earlier this week, the Minnesota Supreme Court
ruled late last month that source code for the Intoxilyzer 5000EN, made by a
Kentucky-based company called CMI, must be handed to defense attorneys for
use in a case involving charges of third- degree DUI against a man named
Dale Lee Underdahl. CMI's historic resistance to such demands has led to
charges being dropped in at least one case outside of Minnesota.  ...

      Assurance

Over the past several months, the state of California conducted the most
comprehensive security review yet of electronic voting machines. People
I consider to be security experts analyzed machines from three different
manufacturers, performing both a red-team attack analysis and a detailed
source code review. Serious flaws were discovered in all machines and,
as a result, the machines were all decertified for use in California
elections.

The reports are worth reading, as is much of the commentary on the
topic. The reviewers were given an unrealistic timetable and had trouble
getting needed documentation. The fact that major security
vulnerabilities were found in all machines is a testament to how poorly
they were designed, not to the thoroughness of the analysis. Yet
California Secretary of State Debra Bowen has conditionally recertified
the machines for use, as long as the makers fix the discovered
vulnerabilities and adhere to a lengthy list of security requirements
designed to limit future security breaches and failures.

While this is a good effort, it has security completely backward. It
begins with a presumption of security: If there are no known
vulnerabilities, the system must be secure. If there is a vulnerability,
then once it's fixed, the system is again secure. How anyone comes to
this presumption is a mystery to me. Is there any version of any
operating system anywhere where the last security bug was found and
fixed? Is there a major piece of software anywhere that has been, and
continues to be, vulnerability-free?

Yet again and again we react with surprise when a system has a
vulnerability. Last weekend at the hacker convention DefCon, I saw new
attacks against supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems
-- those are embedded control systems found in infrastructure systems
like fuel pipelines and power transmission facilities — electronic
badge-entry systems, MySpace, and the high-security locks used in places
like the White House. I will guarantee you that the manufacturers of
these systems all claimed they were secure, and that their customers
believed them.

Earlier this month, the government disclosed that the computer system of
the US-Visit border control system is full of security holes. Weaknesses
existed in all control areas and computing device types reviewed, the
report said. How exactly is this different from any large government
database? I'm not surprised that the system is so insecure; I'm
surprised that anyone is surprised.

We've been assured again and again that RFID passports are secure. When
researcher Lukas Grunwald successfully cloned one last year at DefCon,
industry experts told us there was little risk. This year, Grunwald
revealed that he could use a cloned passport chip to sabotage passport
readers. Government officials are again downplaying the significance of
this result, although Grunwald speculates that this or another similar
vulnerability could be used to take over passport readers and force them
to accept fraudulent passports. Anyone care to guess who's more likely
to be right?

It's all backward. Insecurity is the norm. If any system — whether a
voting machine, operating system, database, badge-entry system, RFID
passport system, etc. — is ever built completely vulnerability-free,
it'll be the first time in the history of mankind. It's not a good bet.

Once you stop thinking about security backward, you immediately
understand why the current software security paradigm of patching
doesn't make us any more secure. If vulnerabilities are so common,
finding a few doesn't materially reduce the quantity remaining. A system
with 100 patched vulnerabilities isn't more secure than a system with
10, nor is it less secure. A patched buffer overflow doesn't mean that
there's one less way attackers can get into your system; it means that
your design process was so lousy that it permitted buffer overflows, and
there are probably thousands more lurking in your code.

Diebold Election Systems has patched a certain vulnerability in its
voting-machine software twice, and each patch contained another
vulnerability. Don't tell me it's my job to find another vulnerability
in the third patch; it's Diebold's job to convince me it has finally
learned how to patch vulnerabilities properly.

Several years ago, former National Security Agency technical director
Brian Snow began talking about the concept of "assurance" in security.
Snow, who spent 35 years at the NSA building systems at security levels
far higher than anything the commercial world deals with, told audiences
that the agency couldn't use modern commercial systems with their
backward security thinking. Assurance was his antidote:

"Assurances are confidence-building activities demonstrating that:
"1. The system's security policy is internally consistent and reflects
    the requirements of the organization,
"2. There are sufficient security functions to support the security policy,
"3. The system functions to meet a desired set of properties and *only*
    those properties,
"4. The functions are implemented correctly, and
"5. The assurances *hold up* through the manufacturing, delivery and
    life cycle of the system."

Basically, demonstrate that your system is secure, because I'm just not
going to believe you otherwise.

Assurance is less about developing new security techniques than about
using the ones we have. It's all the things described in books like
"Building Secure Software," "Software Security," and "Writing Secure
Code."  It's some of what Microsoft is trying to do with its Security
Development Lifecycle (SDL). It's the Department of Homeland Security's
Build Security In program. It's what every aircraft manufacturer goes
through before it puts a piece of software in a critical role on an
aircraft. It's what the NSA demands before it purchases a piece of
security equipment. As an industry, we know how to provide security
assurance in software and systems; we just tend not to bother.

And most of the time, we don't care. Commercial software, as insecure as
it is, is good enough for most purposes. And while backward security is
more expensive over the life cycle of the software, it's cheaper where
it counts: at the beginning. Most software companies are short-term
smart to ignore the cost of never-ending patching, even though it's
long-term dumb.

Assurance is expensive, in terms of money and time for both the process
and the documentation. But the NSA needs assurance for critical military
systems; Boeing needs it for its avionics. And the government needs it
more and more: for voting machines, for databases entrusted with our
personal information, for electronic passports, for communications
systems, for the computers and systems controlling our critical
infrastructure. Assurance requirements should be common in IT contracts,
not rare. It's time we stopped thinking backward and pretending that
computers are secure until proven otherwise.

      More Voting News

California Secretary of State Bowen's certification decisions are
online.  She has totally decertified the ES&amp;S Inkavote Plus system, used
in L.A. County, because of ES&amp;S noncompliance with the Top to Bottom
Review.  The Diebold and Sequoia systems have been decertified and
conditionally recertified.  The same was done with one Hart Intercivic
system (system 6.2.1).  (Certification of the Hart system 6.1 was
voluntarily withdrawn.)  To those who thought she was staging this
review as security theater, this seems like evidence to the contrary.
She wants to do the right thing, but has no idea how to conduct a
security review.

This is amusing, but not particularly unusual — the computer programmed
elision of an overly long concatenation of individual and company names
where a new-line character presumably was omitted.

I just received an "Exclusive Platinum Visa Offer" from First Equity in Fort
Mill, South Carolina, addressed to

   Peter G. Nmnnsri Intrntnl

offering a credit line up to $100K, no annual fee, low rates, and 5% cash
back.  The form is of course already filled in with the above name and
offers an immediate cash advance.  I wonder whether a routine credit check
would cause the application to bounce?  Or perhaps they are so eager for new
customers that they don't even bother with credit checks for people
answering their preprinted exclusive-offer applications?  Or perhaps it is
a total scam?  Well, a Web search gives me the assurance that

  "During the last five years First Equity has not been convicted in a
  criminal proceeding, nor has it been a party to a civil proceeding of a
  judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction."

That is certainly reassuring, but makes one wonder about the preceding
years.  On the other hand, I certainly have enough credit cards already.

I guess it is done this way on purpose: average user does not understand why
they must patch the system and if there is an option on the dialog `I'll
reboot myself', most users will choose it without thinking. There is a way
to stop this countdown: go to services (e.g., Win-R services.msc Enter) and
stop `Automatic Updates'), but this hidden option is akin to self-moderation
of alt.sysadmin.recovery — if one cannot find it, most likely they do not
understand the security implications (of course, there is a risk of
security-savvy users who are new to Windows).

Although, in my opinion, the solution is best for given problem of forcing
reboot on novices, in a reasonable system there should be no need to reboot
for update.
