<address>John Viega &lt;John@list.org&gt;</address>
<i>Mon, 21 Feb 2000 10:35:00 -0800</i>
<pre>
  [This is a nifty piece of work, and presents one more argument for
  open-source software — although I suppose proprietary software purveyors
  might prefer to apply it themselves to closed-source systems!  But it is
  noteworthy that this analytic tool is itself open source.  PGN]

I've put together a command-line tool for statically scanning C and C++
source code for security vulnerabilities.  The tool is called ITS4.  ITS4
scans through source code for potentially dangerous function calls that are
stored in a database.  Anything that is in the database gets flagged.  ITS4
tries to automate a lot of the grepping usually done by hand when performing
security audits.

The tool is available from: <a href="http://www.rstcorp.com/its4/">http://www.rstcorp.com/its4/</a>
Also on this site is a research paper on ITS4 submitted to this year's
Usenix Security conference.

ITS4 is open source software.  The license puts some minor restrictions on
commercial use.  In essence, you can't use this tool to make money (such as
by reselling it, or by using it in a consulting practice).  However, you are
encouraged to run the tool on your own product in order to make it better.

ITS4 does more than just grep-type work.  It allows for arbitrary handlers
to refine the initial analysis.  This version of ITS4 comes with some simple
handlers.  Some of these handlers check for uses of common string operations
that often are not significant problems.  For example:

  strcpy(buf, "\n");
  sprintf(buf, "%d", i);

In the first case, ITS4 will look at the second argument to a strcpy.  If it
is a string constant, the severity of the problem site is reduced to the
lowest possible level.  The tool will not output this kind of problem in its
standard mode.  In the second case, a similar reduction in severity occurs,
since the sprintf format string contains no %s's.

The tool also has handlers that scan for file access race conditions,
similar to the prototype tool discussed in [BD96].  We slightly improve on
their tool by allowing for interprocedural and intermodular problems.

There are some technical limitations to this tool, many of which we hope to
improve in the future.  We'd like to have the help of the security
community.  I'm personally dedicated to improving this tool, and Reliable
Software Technologies is willing to put some resources towards doing so.
Changes from the community will certainly be considered for inclusion in
future ITS4 releases.

Currently, the weakest area of ITS4, where the input of the security
community is most important, is the vulnerability database, which was
largely taken from some very preliminary work done by Tom O'Connor.  It's
perhaps a good start, but far from complete.  Many new things could be
added, and the entries that do exist can likely be improved substantially.
For each database entry, we have a description, a default severity, and a
recommended alternative.  Generally, the descriptions are pretty scant, and
the severities are not overly well thought out.

The next area for improvement is the handlers.  It would be great to see
people writing some good handlers, or even suggesting good handlers, and
then we could write them.

Beyond that we're interested in the following:

1) Flagging the allocation mechanism used on important variables
  (i.e., stack-allocated buffers are usually easier to exploit than
   heap-allocated buffers if there is an overflow).

2) Performing much better static analysis.  We'd probably like to
   start by building some sort of heuristic alias analysis, and then
   doing something similar to the analysis done in [WF+00].

We do have plans to ultimately do these things, but if other people want to
code them up and contribute to the project, that's great.

I've set up a mailing list for people who are interested in helping out in
any capacity.  Hopefully we can get a good discussion going that will
improve the vulnerability database, and make ITS4 a far more useful tool.

According to a 17 Feb 2000 AP item (18 Feb 2000 article in *The Washington
Post* by David Ignatius, the US State Department has its shorts in a knot
because they have just realized that a software package called the Mission
Performance Plan that is running on embassy computers around the world was
written by programmers from the former Soviet Union.  On 2 Feb 2000, the
Department of State sent an urgent cable to 170 embassies ordering them to
remove the package by the 7th while security specialists examine the code
for trap doors, logic bombs and other cybernasties.

  [Comment by MK: this incident reinforces the view that the trustability of
  software writers is even more important than quality assurance where
  security is concerned.  As many commentators have noted, it may be
  impossible in practice to apply adequate quality assurance to untrusted
  code.  I have frequently urged QA specialists to ensure that they use
  code-coverage logging to ensure that every line of code is actually
  executed during the SQA process; however, even total coverage does not
  necessarily mean that a program is guaranteed safe, since variable sequence
  of execution could result in different outcomes for the same subroutines
  because of data dependencies.]

The Crash of a Dot.Gov, by Declan McCullagh (declan@wired.com)

Wired, 15 Feb 2000

As government aides were frantically preparing for the president's
last-minute Internet-reliability summit with technology leaders, thousands
of visitors couldn't reach the U.S. Senate's own Web site.  It was offline
for over nine hours Monday, from early afternoon to after 11 p.m.  (EST) due
to technical problems, Senate officials said.  The embarrassing site failure
comes just as the U.S. government is telling private firms how important it
is that they increase the reliability and security of their own networks.
"Our administration has been working for years now to reduce vulnerabilities
in government computers and to encourage the private sector to do more,"
President Clinton said before Tuesday's one-hour meeting with corporate
information officers, academics, and Cabinet members.

A new state-run computer system for the Tulsa County Court Clerk's Office
that was supposed to be the envy of the rest of the country is still
malfunctioning, sometimes for days on end.  The new system was put in place
just a few days before the end of 1999 in an effort to make the court
records system Y2K compliant. Still, (Sally) Howe Smith said, the old days
under the clunky mainframe are starting to look pretty good.  The new system
has been down completely for at least a day twice in the last two weeks and
regularly has system errors that hinder access to records for hours at a
time, she said.  The court records system uses Windows 2000, and the new
software was deployed early for the state system. (Website coordinator
Gregg) Lambert said state technicians were hoping to confer with Microsoft
officials about some of the system's problems.

<i>Fri, 18 Feb 2000 09:59:43 -0800</i>
<pre>
Microsoft (hereinafter MS) Windows 2000 has a kind of "immune system"
feature which causes it to reject any driver or DLL update which has not
been digitally signed by Microsoft.  The signature system looks to be
similar to Authenticode.

In <a href="/Risks/18/89">RISKS-18.89</a>, I suggested that the real utility of MS' Authenticode was to
assist MS marketing.  I offered a test for my hypothesis: that an offer by
MS to sign others' code (for a fee) would validate my theory.

Well, if you want to supply a new device driver (say, for a variant
peripheral) or library update (adding, say, some spiffy cryptographic
features) for Windows 2000, you must give your code to MS for early review
and pay MS a fee.  If you do these things, MS may sign your software.  If
you do not, then no Windows 2000 machine will run your code (or at least,
not without big trouble, too big for non-techies).

As with Authenticode, MS' scheme is not unbreakable, nor does it even
attempt to assure the quality (as opposed to the provenance) of signed code.
(Oh, MS says their lab will review 3rd-party code for "compatibility," but
they won't check for malware, and unlike, say, Java's sandbox, MS signature
scheme has no inherent malware-inhibiting qualities).

MS marketing will stop at nothing, Q.E.D..

&gt; ...pronounce "DoS" to rhyme with "sauce" — and sound just like "DOS".

For those of us that don't speak American that sentence makes no sense at
all.  The pronunciation of "DOS" comes nowhere near that of "sauce".  In
English, they rhyme more with "moss" and "morse" (with a silent `r')
respectively.  Risky assumptions about your readership?

  [Webster of course gives a British spin on "doss" --
     1. doss \'da:s\ vi [origin unknown] chiefly Brit :
       to sleep or bed down in any convenient place
     2. doss n chiefly Brit : a crude or makeshift bed
  Dictionaries and linguistic differences make strange bedfellows.
  I presume the OED doss even better.  But phonetically auf deutsch, we have
  "Dos ist gut, net?" (where "net" is regional dialect for "nicht").  PGN]

It took a few seconds for me make any sense at all of his comment: when did
"DOS" ever rhyme with "sauce"?! And then I realised that Ken is probably an
American-English speaker and that he had missed another risk: that all
readers of english will pronounce words the same way.

This reminds me of a counter example.

Three or four years ago the following joke made the rounds.

    "What do you get if you cross Lee Iacocca with a vampire?

        AUTOEXEC.BAT"

I was astounded at how many people got it.  Even technophobes and Mac owners
understood it and laughed.  Maybe Murray Hill NJ would be the only place on
earth that it would flop. :)

My point is that these things are less jargon-like than we might think.
They are at least slang and perhaps mainstream American English by now.

The recent flurry of discussions and warnings about cross site scripting is
but one more reminder of the vulnerabilities that result from the basic
design (?) of the internet, http, scripting languages, and most browsers.

Meanwhile, we find that more and more sites refuse to function unless
javascript and/or cookies are enabled. Some warn us of this. Some,
www.anybirthday.com for example, just give misleading results. And of
course, some Microsoft sites demand Internet Explorer with vbscript turned
on.

There seems to be a clear cut choice between "safe browsing" and access to a
lot of the information that is available on the web. Web sites could be
designed to work acceptably without client side scripting, but it is
unlikely that many folks will decide to do so.

So, I guess I'm just complaining. Does anyone have a better idea?

electronic 'cookies,' or electronic surveillance files, on hard drives of
users' computers without their knowledge or consent." In addition, the

This "advanced" analyzer generates "significant" false positives. I guess it

&gt; The bug is with pine — it returns multipart/alternative and
&gt; should have returned multipart/mixed.  [...]

This is the sort of "force the user to adapt to the software instead of
vice-versa" attitude that seems to permeate PC software. I find it
incredibly frustrating that I'm constantly fighting software because someone
assumes their way is the ONLY way something should be done.

Just because the client is HTML-aware doesn't mean it should hide the
alternatives from you. My personal choice for e-mail (not what I'm forced to
use at work) tells me there are alternate views available and lets me choose
which one I would like to view. Sometimes I get e-mail which is all
HTML. Having an HTML-aware client is handy in these cases. However, I don't
like HTML, I don't want HTML, and given a choice I will view as non-HTML. A
product which forces HTML on me is broken, IMHO.

I agree that in this case there is a problem with Pine. However, while
Outlook may be working as designed I would certainly argue that it is not
working as it should!

<a name="subj12.1" href="#subj12.1" id="subj12.1"><img border="0" src="/Images/Misc/flash.gif" width="14" height="14" alt=""></a> Two signatures</h3>
<address>"David E. Ross" &lt;rossde@acm.org&gt;</address>
<i>Sun, 20 Feb 2000 15:18:11 -0800</i>
<pre>
The situation:

Because of high-speed processing of bank checks without any human
intervention, banks (at least in California) will no longer honor requests
by depositors that checks have two signatures.  Even when a check has
imprinted on it "Two Signatures Required", banks will honor that check with
only one signature.

When establishing a new account or when changing signature authorizations on
existing accounts, banks are requiring depositors to sign a waiver that
releases the bank from any liability for paying a check with only one
signature.  As long as the signature is in the bank's files, the loss will
then fall on the depositor even if the signature card in the files or the
check clearly indicates "Two Signatures Required".

The risk:

This can be a problem for non-profit organizations, many of which depend on
amateur help — unpaid volunteers — to handle administrative tasks,
including disbursing funds.  The California Attorney General — who
regulates charities through the state's Registry of Charitable Trusts --
recognizes the risk of embezzlement or other losses and strongly urges all
non-profits to require two signatures on all checks.  The use of a single
authorized signature on a check has already proven insufficient.  Losses to
PTAs, high school booster clubs, and other volunteer-run non-profits are far
too common.

Of course, businesses and other organizations are also at risk of loss
without the safeguard of requiring two individuals to approve payments of
funds.  For that reason, a company's independent auditors will often require
the use of two signatures if they are to certify the adequacy of the
company's internal fiscal controls.

Some questions:

Automated pattern-recognition capabilities might not be sufficient to verify
check signatures.  However, the technology has surely advanced to the point
where at least the presence of two signatures could be verified.  It
certainly can detect a preprinted "Two Signatures Required" on a check.  Why
have the banks not incorporated this technology into their check-clearing
systems?

The banks claim they cannot stop the automated processing of checks and
examine each check to ensure that it has the correct number of signatures.
That is why they do not want to be held liable when a check marked "Two
Signatures Required" is honored with only one signature.  However, they also
cannot stop the automated processing of checks and examine each check to
ensure that it has a valid, authorized signature.  Yet they remain liable if
a check with an invalid signature is paid.  What is the difference?

<address>Thomas Roessler &lt;roessler@guug.de&gt;</address>
<i>Mon, 21 Feb 2000 13:18:58 +0100</i>
<pre>
Amazon.de has a very simple scheme for changing your account's password in
case you forget it: Just tell their server your e-mail address, the title or
ISBN number of a book you have ordered with them, and the last five digits
of a bank account or credit card number you have used to pay.  The server
will happily permit you to change your password.

The RISK?  The information to be supplied may be easily guessed.

Bank account numbers are readily accessible to - almost - the public; it's
even common to put them onto letterheads.  As opposed to credit card
numbers, they aren't treated as secrets. Guessing what books have been
ordered can frequently be easy, too - people tell about books, people write
reviews, or you just know peoples' interests.  Trying best-sellers will work
nicely as a large-scale attack.

The one and only element of control you have is a confirmation message sent
to your e-mail address.  While this may work if you are reading your e-mail
regularly, a prolonged week-end vacation may be sufficient for an attacker
to order a book, get it paid with your credit card (or from your bank
account), and get it delivered to some empty building.

Bounces should honor the Received: line count and add an extra one. Not only
does this prevent infinite loops, but it also makes spam more trackable.

I'd think many already do something to prevent infinite looping; otherwise
what happens if a from address is invalid? Bounce bounce bounce... until

When I called after a couple of days to ask why I did not get a confirmation
in the mail, I was informed that my credit-card processing was not complete
as they had incorrect information about my ZIP code.  I did ask as to why I
was not informed and they said they di try to do so - by sending me a post
card!!!  YES, that's right - to inform me that they had an incorrect address
on file they "mail" a post card.

I did speak to a supervisor who informed that "this is the official policy".
I did ask him how this could be implemented and how it would work - "this is
official policy".

The only way to inform Customer Relations is to call or send mail via the
USPS.  They do not have an e-mail address.

Try reading the privacy policy of &lt;<a href="http://www.foxkids.com">http://www.foxkids.com</a>&gt; using Internet
Explorer 4.5 on the Macintosh. Be sure to use a color monitor and enable the
"allow page to specify fonts and colors" option. You will see tiny black
text on a dark blue image background: i.e., essentially unreadable.

If you turn off "show images," you get black text on a black background.

On Netscape Communicator, you get white text on the blue image, which is
readable, even though the size "0" text is tough going without a magnifying
glass. It's about 8 pt on my display.

The problem is that the page explicitly sets the page background color to
"black" but does not set the default text color. The heading text "by using
this site, you agree to the privacy policy of FK [Fox Kids] ..." is rendered
in a HTML table element whose font is explicitly set "white", but the rest
of the page, containing the policy itself, lacks an explicit font
color. Netscape apparently continues to use the current font and text color
until changed, while Internet Explorer reverts to the default color when the
table element completes.

The entire privacy document is over 3,000 words long, but that's another
story.
