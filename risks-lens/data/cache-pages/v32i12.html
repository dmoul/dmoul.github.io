<p>
British naturalist Charles Darwin got it right, but maybe we got Darwin
wrong.
</p>
<p>
Most people assume that Darwin was talking about physical strength when
referring to <em>survival of the fittest</em>, meaning that a tougher, more
resilient species always will win out over its weaker counterparts. But
what if he didn't mean that at all?
</p>
<p>
Scientists Brian Hare and Vanessa Woods, both researchers at Duke
University's Center for Cognitive Neuroscience, believe something else has
been at work among species that have thrived throughout history,
successfully reproducing to sustain themselves, and it has nothing to do
with beating up the competition.
</p>
<p>
Their new book, Survival of the Friendliest: Understanding Our Origins and
Rediscovering Our Common Humanity &lt;<a href="https://amzn.to/30tOgez">https://amzn.to/30tOgez</a><i class="shield fad fa-shield"></i><i class="fad fa-flashlight flashlight"></i>&gt;, posits that
friendly partnerships among species and shared humanity have worked
throughout centuries to ensure successful evolution. Species endure —
humans, other animals and plants - they write, based on friendliness,
partnership and communication. And they point to many life examples of
cooperation and sociability to prove it.
</p>
<p>
“Survival of fittest, which is what everyone has in mind as evolution and
natural selection, has done the most harm of any folk theory that has
penetrated society,” Hare says. “People think of it as strong alpha males
who deserve to win. That's not what Darwin suggested, or what has been
demonstrated. The most successful strategy in life is friendliness and
cooperation, and we see it again and again.”
</p>
<p>
“Dogs are exhibit A. They are the extremely friendly descendants of
wolves. They were attracted to humans and became friendly to humans, and
changed their behavior, appearance and developmental makeup. Sadly, their
close relative, the wolf, is threatened and endangered in the few places
where they live, whereas there are hundreds of millions of dogs. Dogs were
the population of wolves that decided to rely on humans - rather than
hunting - and that population won big.”
</p>
<p>
In nature, for example, flowering plants attract animals to spread their
pollen, forming a partnership that benefits both. “The plants provide food
and energy, while the animals provide transportation for the pollen,” Hare
says. […]

A hacker group <em>almost certainly</em> backed by Russia is trying to steal
COVID-19-related vaccine research in Canada, the U.K. and the U.S.,
according to intelligence agencies in all three countries.
</p>
<p>
The Communications Security Establishment (CSE), responsible for Canada's
foreign signals intelligence, said APT29 - also known as Cozy Bear and the
Dukes - is behind the malicious activity.
</p>
<p>
The group was accused of hacking the Democratic National Committee before
the 2016 U.S. election.

Boeing is also scrambling to prove it can fly astronauts safely to low Earth
orbit. In December, a test flight of its Starliner spacecraft without any
astronauts onboard ran into trouble as soon as it reached orbit. A software
problem reminiscent of the issues with the 737 Max made the spacecraft think
it was at a different point in the mission. As engineers moved to fix that
problem, they uncovered another that could have caused the service module to
collide with the crew module when they separated in flight. They were able
to quickly send up a software fix to that problem so that the two modules
separated cleanly.
</p>
<p>
The problems prevented the spacecraft from docking with the International
Space Station, and Boeing had to bring the spacecraft home after just two
days.
</p>
<p>
Since then, NASA and Boeing launched an investigation, and Boeing said it
has better integrated its hardware and software teams, and has taken a hard
look at its culture and processes. It's also reviewed all 1 million lines of
code in the spacecraft “resulting in increased robustness of flight
software,” the company said in a statement to The Post. […]
</p>
<p>
Nearly a decade after winning the Air Force contract to build a fleet of
KC-46 Pegasus aerial refueling tankers, Boeing's assembly lines outside of
Seattle have been busy. The company has delivered 34 of the planes so far.
</p>
<p>
But the military has said it won't be able to use them for most missions
until at least 2023 because of persistent technical flaws.
</p>
<p>
The plane's boom, the long tube through which fuel is transferred, isn't
flexible enough to safely link up with smaller jets. And the Defense
Department's testing office has determined that the complex camera system
that guides the boom into place isn't accurate enough. The Air Force also
has repeatedly found trash, wrenches and other debris scattered inside newly
delivered jets.

It turns out someone in Microsoft's quality assurance team (There is one,
RIGHT!?) didn't bother to test the newest edition of Outlook with the latest
version of Windows. I mean why would you want to check that e-mail, an
application almost no one uses today, actually works with your main
operating system??
</p>
<p>
The truth is there was never anything wrong with your PST files. Somehow,
the combination of the newest versions of Outlook and Windows led to a total
failure. The fix required you to manually edit your registry “ always a fun
job for a user who's miles away from the closest tech support staff.

Machine learning is a black box. That makes it a double-edged sword?

In 2016, a strange self-driving car was released onto the quiet roads of
Monmouth County, New Jersey. The experimental vehicle, developed by
researchers at the chip maker Nvidia, didn't look different from other
autonomous cars, but it was unlike anything demonstrated by Google, Tesla,
or General Motors, and it showed the rising power of artificial
intelligence. The car didn't follow a single instruction provided by an
engineer or programmer. Instead, it relied entirely on an algorithm that
had taught itself to drive by watching a human do it.

A somewhat apocryphal story I've heard (but now cannot verify), at the time
when AI systems were just making their first steps in the world:
</p>
<p>
A graduate student was tasked with generating an AI system to distinguish
between benign and malignant cells in microscope images, for research at a
local hospital. The hospital gave him a pile of images, and an oncologist
doctor to help him decipher them.
</p>
<p>
So they sat down, and the doctor started to go over the images, stating
“this is malignant, this is not, this is malignant…” The student had to
stop her “but can you please explain a bit more about how you make the
distinction?” She looked at him sternly and said “Look, young man; I've
been doing this for 30 years now, and when I say it's malignant, it's
malignant!.”
</p>
<p>
I hope AI systems had improved since then!

It seems that the old principle is still valid: “If you're not paying,

No such thing as a free lunch, as the saying goes. This has been the case
for many other topics over the years; just from my memory:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Since I was a kid, garages have been offering “have a free safety check
  on your car from us”, which makes cynics wonder how the ‘free’ offer is
  paid for.</li>
<li>Not sure if this is still the case, but in the UK banks often used to
  provide travel insurance as one of the benefits of holding an account,
  either ‘free’ or with a modest additional payment. Reportedly the problem
  is that this will likely be a minimum-cost generic policy which may not
  actually meet your needs and/or may have unexpected limitations,
  e.g. ‘hazardous activities’, which could be anything. If you've actually
  paid for your insurance, you're more likely to get what you wanted.
</li>
<li>Historically, buying a house in the UK was strictly controlled; mortgages
  were generally only obtainable from building societies (non-profit
  organisations run like credit unions) and only proper lawyers could do
  conveyancing (handling the sale contract and title deed documents). In
  the early 1980s these controls were relaxed so loads of financial
  organisations now offer mortgages. As it happened, a work colleague was
  buying his first house at the time, and a common offer was “if you get
  your mortgage from us we'll give you free conveyancing,” but as he said,
  if you are paying for the lawyer yourself, you know who he/she is working
  for.
</li>
<li>Businesses offering maintenance and repair work may offer fixed-price
  jobs, which appear to have the attraction of avoiding any nasty surprises
  with the bill, but I have a feeling that unexpected costs may be against
  your interests and in favour of the business, in the sense that the
  business will try to do the work as cheaply as possible as this is to
  their benefit, while they may be less inclined to put in any extra effort
  to deal with unexpected difficulties.
</li>
</ul>

The <em>bird strike</em> term labels a cruel and unfortunate incident in use since
1988 per <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_strike">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_strike</a><i class="shield fad fa-shield"></i><i class="fad fa-flashlight flashlight"></i>.
</p>
<p>
The FAA's wildlife strike reporting mechanism was a serendipitous discovery
via web search query for <em>bird strike</em> while composing.
</p>
<p>
I was surprised to learn of the reporting system's existence, and supposed a
simple calculation of incident rate would inform the flying public.

While I assume that the correspondent's tongue is planted in their cheek, I
would like to point out that according to maritime rules of the road (and I
would guess that aviation rules are similar), the more maneuverable craft is
supposed to give way to the less maneuverable craft should their courses
intersect. If I, operating a personal watercraft such as what is
colloquially referred to as a <em>jet ski</em>, were mowed down by a Panamax-class
container ship under the command of the correspondent, the latter would
likely not be held responsible, as I should have given way to the bloody big
fat and fast moving other vessel.

(Removing <em>my</em> tongue from my cheek at this point.)
