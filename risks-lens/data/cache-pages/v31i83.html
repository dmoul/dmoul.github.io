Massachusetts issues the same license plate number for different vehicles.
So as the news article ref'ed below states, ”there could be Mass passenger
1234, but also commercial 1234, Cape and Island 1234, Red Sox, Purple Heart,
and more.”
</p>
<p>
The EZ Pass readers/back systems in Mass perform some sort of Arthur C.
Clarke Magic [<sup>*</sup>] to determine which vehicle should get charged, but when the
license plate is scanned in other states, well…
</p>
<blockquote>
  A local couple was home, sheltering in place during the pandemic. So why
  was their car was being charged for tolls in another state? Hank's
  investigation gets answers and action.
</blockquote>
<p>
Cynthia's red four-door sits in her Concord driveway. Exactly where it's
been for weeks.  […]  So when Cynthia got her April EZ Pass bill she was
baffled. It said her car went through tolls in New York, a COVID hot
spot. […]
</p>
<blockquote>
  [It turned out that one of the local ambulances, with the same basic plate
  number, was part of the FEMA mutual aid response in NYC, which went
  through lots and lots of bridge and tunnel tollgates every day.  Lots and
  lots of bills.]

Chinese cyber-espionage presents a huge challenge but almost all spying is
carried out by means of applications and phishing, rather than through
infrastructure…

As is usually the case, a risk arises from people overestimating the
applicability of their expertise.  Specifically, commercial software
developers “reviewing” a COVID simulation numerical model without
understanding its requirements or how scientific software is applied.
<a href="https://philbull.wordpress.com/2020/05/10/why-you-can-ignore-reviews-of-scientific-code-by-commercial-software-developers/amp/">https://philbull.wordpress.com/2020/05/10/why-you-can-ignore-reviews-of-scientific-code-by-commercial-software-developers/amp/</a>
</p>
<p>
The risk is that public trust in what was probably an excellent analysis
(I'm not an epidemiologist so I couldn't possibly say - and neither can
they) will be undermined by tech-bro egos.

This week, as Virginia has faced continuing criticism for its lag in
widespread coronavirus testing even as it gears up to reopen large swaths of
the state, government officials are grappling with yet another backlash.
</p>
<p>
Media reports, including a story in the Richmond Times-Dispatch and a
scathing article in The Atlantic, highlighted that the state was including
antibody testing in its overall coronavirus testing numbers, artificially
boosting those numbers and driving down the percentage of positive cases.
</p>
<p>
Governor Northam has repeatedly cited increased testing capacity as the main
reason that most of Virginia will begin to re-open starting this Friday.
</p>
<p>
On Thursday, the Virginia Department of Health announced they would no
longer include the results of antibody tests in their overall data, though
officials stressed that its inclusion did not significantly alter the trends
that aided the governor in making the decision to reopen.  About 15,000
antibody tests had been included, making up about nine percent of the
overall testing number.
</p>
<p>
The commonwealth says the inclusion of this antibody testing data wasn't
done on purpose—it was the fault of an automatic computer programming
system.
</p>

Same as HAL 9000, Colossus the Forbin Project, etc. No human's fault…

The app, which allows people to record their symptoms, was remarkably
effective in predicting infections. The most reliable indicators,
researchers found, were loss of smell and taste.

<em>COVID-19 lack of symptoms compared to Zika outbreaks</em>
</p>
<h4>
EXCERPT:
</h4>
<p>
The share of people who are infected with the coronavirus but never get sick
varies widely from place to place, from less than 20% of cruise ship
passengers in Japan to a whopping 95% of inmates at an Ohio prison,
underscoring the challenge in weeding out infections and isolating the virus
as parts of the world reopen.
</p>
<p>
During the mosquito-borne Zika outbreak in 2015 and 2016, scientists were
confident that 75% of those infected would not develop symptoms.
</p>
<p>
But scientists are having a hard time pinpointing a global average for
COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, and are finding
different rates in different places.
</p>
<p>
A study in Iceland found that half of those who tested positive for the
coronavirus infection showed no signs of illness. Nearly 1 in 5, or 17.9%,
of infected passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship off Japan were
asymptomatic, according to a March study.
</p>
<p>
The Center for Evidence-Based Medicine at Oxford University said 50% to 70%
of people in an Italian village west of Venice were asymptomatic, compared
with 31% of Japanese nationals evacuated from Wuhan, China, where the
outbreak began in December. […]

<h4>
EXCERPT:
</h4>
<p>
The coronavirus has prompted almost two-thirds of American believers of all
faiths to feel that God is telling humanity to change how it lives, a new
poll finds.
</p>
<p>
While the virus rattles the globe, causing economic hardship for millions
and killing more than 80,000 Americans, the findings of the poll by the
University of Chicago Divinity School and The Associated Press-NORC Center
for Public Affairs Research indicate that people may also be searching for
deeper meaning in the devastating outbreak.
</p>
<p>
Even some who don't affiliate with organized religion, such as Lance Dejesus
of Dallastown, Pa., saw a possible bigger message in the virus. […]

Wol missed the point of Baker's article: That running a computer program
twice with the same inputs (including PRNG seed, if relevant) should produce
identical (not just similar) outputs. If not, something is VERY wrong, and
output is essentially useless. You just don't know what you are doing.
</p>
<p>
Reproducibility in science is something different: Repeating an experiment
or observation, or doing a different experiment to determine the same
parameters, gives you confidence in the results if they give similar (but
not strictly identical) results.
</p>
<p>
In astronomy, you do observe the same objects using different telescopes,
different methods, etc. So also here, finding similar results helps you gain
confidence in the results.

I can think of a few reasons why a whole-building air handler in multiple
dwelling buildings, posited by Geoff Goodfellow, would be impractical
besides its potential to distribute pathogens:
</p>
<ol>
<li> In case of fire, smoke and toxic fumes could be distributed throughout
the building;
</li>
<li>
Cooking odors could be distributed throughout the building;
</li>
<li>
Impractically large ductwork would be required to carry large quantities
of heat over long distances in the building via moving air.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
I've lived in two high rise residential buildings with central air
conditioning. In neither building is air from throughout the building mixed
in a central chamber. In one building, chilled water is distributed to fan
coil units located in each room. A fan, controlled by a thermostat in the
room, blows room air over the chilled coils. In the other building, central
A/C is provided by heat pumps in each unit, almost in the usual way, except
that the heat pump transfers room heat to water that circulates throughout
the building, rather than to a refrigerant circuit. The circulating water
passes through a rooftop cooling tower which transfers the heat to the
outdoors.

<a href="/Risks/31/82">RISKS Digest 31.82</a> reported a story that “All California voters will
receive mail-in ballots for November”
</p>
<p>
Far more than “all voters” will receive mail-in ballots. California will
mail to inactive addresses too: “over 458,000 likely dead or relocated
persons will be mailed ballots…  Almost 178,000 have <em>never</em> voted…
Mass ‘seeding’ of unclaimed ballots, coupled with ballot ‘harvesting’ by
unscrupulous operatives, is a significant risk to the integrity of the
November election.”
<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hundreds-of-thousands-of-ineligible-persons-could-be-mailed-ballots-if-california-goes-all-mail-in-november-election-301055445.html">https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hundreds-of-thousands-of-ineligible-persons-could-be-mailed-ballots-if-california-goes-all-mail-in-november-election-301055445.html</a>
</p>
<p>
Accepting mailed ballots depends purely on comparing one signature on the
outside of the envelope to one or more signatures on file. Comparisons are
often automated. Successful computer matches are not always reviewed, and
false match rates are unknown. “[A]lgorithms that look for a certain number
of points of similarity between the compared signatures… different brands
of machines are used…  ES&amp;S, Olympus, Vantage, Pitney Bowes, Runbeck, and
Bell &amp; Howell… a wide range of algorithms and standards, each particular
to that machine's manufacturer, are used to verify signatures. In addition,
counties have discretion in managing the settings and implementing
manufacturers' guidelines… there are no statewide standards for automatic
signature verification… most counties do not have a publicly available,
written explanation of the signature verification criteria and processes
they use”
<a href="https://www-cdn.law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/FINAL-Signature-Verification-Report-4-15-20.pdf">https://www-cdn.law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/FINAL-Signature-Verification-Report-4-15-20.pdf</a>
</p>
<p>
For manual signature reviews, that same Stanford study says, “Most counties
review ballot signatures with a basic presumption in favor of counting each
ballot… [Some] declare that just three or even one matching
characteristic between the ballot signature and the comparison signature
will be sufficient to find a match… many county officials expressed that
evaluating ballot signatures is made substantially harder by the decline of
cursive education and by the use of electronic signature pads during DMV
registration, which often produce blurry signatures or flatten otherwise
distinctive elements of a signature. Both issues disproportionately affect
younger voters, who are more likely to have registered on an electronic
signature pad and are less likely to have learned cursive in school. The
registrar of one Bay Area county explained that she 'cannot compare a
printed name to a signature,' and that people printing rather than signing
their names on their ballots is ‘becoming more prevalent over time.’ ”
Stanford says that signatures also vary more from people who rarely use
Roman characters, such as some Asian-Americans.
</p>
<p>
“election officials with little or no training in verifying a person's
signature are tasked with doing just that…  it's unlikely that only one or
two samples will show the spectrum of a person's normal variations…  Even
major treatises on handwriting analysis concede that it is extremely
difficult for anyone to be able to figure out if a signature or other very
limited writing sample has been forged…”

</p>
<p>
California requires less than a week notice to voters to cure
discrepancies. Many states allow less time than that. (And Stanford says
they often still require a new signature to match a signature on file.)

</p>
<p>
I fully support all-mail voting this year. We need to measure and minimize
false-positive and false-negative signature verification. What levels will
be acceptable?  There's scope to suppress young voters and Asian-American
voters.
