Joshua Levy comments in <a href="/Risks/9/02">Risks 9.2</a> on the UK MoD Std:

   &lt;&gt;1. There should be no dynamic memory allocation (This rules out explicit
   &lt;&gt;   recursion - though a bounded stack is allowed).
   &lt;&gt;2. There should be no interupts except for a regular clock interupt.
   &lt;&gt;3. There should not be any distributed processing
   &lt;&gt;4. There should not be any multiprocessing.

 &gt;As a practical matter, these requirements rule out most (all?) real systems.
 &gt;Also, I do not see why software which does none of these things is safer than
 &gt;software which does all of them.  These requirements seems to be designed to
 &gt;compensate for the (huge) limitations of current program verification
 &gt;techniques.

Much safety-critical software is built this way already; it is simply untrue
that these limitations rule out real systems.  Software with these
characteristics is safer because it is deterministic rather than
non-deterministic — the number of states may often be reduced to a small
enough number to perform extensive (and sometimes exhaustive) testing and
analysis.  No dynamic storage allocation also ensures that the system will not
run out of memory during a critical operation:  Again the goal is to make the
software predictable and analyzable.  Norm Finn, in the same issue of Risks,
explains the reasons for and practicality of eliminating interrupts.

Safety-critical systems are built this way in order to perform effective
verification (e.g., testing and analysis) in general — it has nothing to do
with the limitations of formal verification.  I refer you to the design of the
software for a nuclear reactor shutdown system described in my Computing
Surveys article (June 1986) as an example and an explanation of the purpose of
such restrictions.

 &gt;Of course writing a compiler which does not use dynamic memory (see point 1)
 &gt;would be an interesting exercise!

You misunderstood — the limitation is on the object code, not on the
compiler.  If the compiler runs out of memory and fails to produce object
code, this is not a hazard.

 &gt;Overall, I found these standards funny, not useful.  My conclusion is that no
 &gt;safety critical software can not be written in the UK since points 1 and 2
 &gt;will mean that none of it will be up to standard.

I cannot understand how this conclusion follows.  There is already software
performing safety-critical functions that satisfies these standards.  In my
experience, the software that has killed people in the past has almost always
used unnecessarily complex programming techniques.  For example, the Therac
deaths were related to race conditions in the software created by the use of
multitasking (which was not necessary to implement the required functionality).
The nondeterminism involved makes it impossible to thoroughly test or analyze
the Therac software to eliminate such critical errors.

The most effective way to increase the reliability of software that we
currently know about is simply to make it understandable and predictable.
Although there may be many very good reasons for using sophisticated
programming techniques, increased reliability and safety are usually not among
them.  When human life is involved, most real systems make tradeoffs in the
direction of simplicity and predictability.

For the most part, the new UK standard just specifies current standard practice
for safety-critical software used by those most experienced in building such
software.

<i>3 Jul 1989 17:19:30 EST</i>
<pre>
At the COMPASS '88 meeting last summer, John Cullyer described a quality study
on modules selected from the NATO software inventory that was performed at the
Royal Signals and Radar Establishment (RSRE), the central electronics research
laboratory of the UK Ministry of Defence (MOD).  Here is mention of that study
from a recent paper, "High Integrity Computing", by W.J. Culler, pages 1-35 in
"Formal Techniques in Real-Time and Fault-Tolerant Systems (Lecture Notes in
Computer Science No. 331)", edited by M. Joseph, Springer-Verlag 1988:

``One of the techniques which has been developed to provide objective evidence
  of the correctness of software is called `static code analysis' ... (which
  uses) algebraic methods which are totally independent of dynamic testing...''

Application of static code analysis since 1985 has revealed some worrying
results.  Taking a broad average over the software checked by MOD or by
contractors on behalf of MOD, up to 10 percent of the individual software
modules have been shown to deviate from the original specification.  Such
discrepancies have been found even in software that has been subject to
extensive testing on multi-million pound test rigs.  Many of the anomalies
detected have been minor and did not threaten the integrity of the system
being monitored.

However, about 1 in 20 of the defective functions that static code analysis
had shown to be faulty, i.e., about 1 in every 200 of all new modules, proved
to have errors that would have resulted in direct and observable effects
on the vehicle or plant concerned.  For example, potential overflows in
integer arithmetic appears to be a common problem, involving a change in
sign of the result of a calculation and hence the possibility of an actuator
being driven in a dangerous direction.''

At COMPASS, Cullyer said about the same proportion of faulty modules was
discovered in the British, American and German contributions.  He also
mentioned that the British MOD's interest in formal methods was motivated by
several near-miss accidents involving computers that he said he was not
permitted to discuss.

In a TV news report last evening (7/6) on the computer shutdown at O'Hare
Airport, the reporter commented that the skies were actually safer as a result,
which he attributed to two causes: first, that there was less air traffic and
second, that "pilots are relying on their knowledge and their skills rather
than on a computer."

<i>Fri, 7 Jul 89 11:22:25 EDT</i>
<pre>
The investigation continues into the Southern Pacific May 11 Cajon wreck.  This
was the incident where an SP potash unit train lost its brakes while descending
Cajon Pass, a grade in excess of 2%.  The train roared down the hill as the
crew radioed they were out of control; it reached 90 mph before jumping the
track and crashing into a neighborhood near San Bernadino.  Three persons were
killed, eight injured, and 11 homes destroyed.

New information indicates an inaccurate calculation of the train's tonnage.
Press reports indicated the train contained 69 cars with a weight of 6150 tons,
but an SP assistant chief dispatcher has since estimated the actual weight as
8950 tons.  Had the crew known the train's additional weight, they might have
set up the air brakes sooner.  Faulty dynamic brakes were found in one of the
four lead engines and one of the two pushers.  As the train crested the hill,
the lead engineer radioed the pusher engineer to ask if he was "giving all [the
dynamic braking] he had;" the rear engineer answered "yes" even though he told
investigators that he was aware the dynamic brakes were not working.

David Gursky's comments about grocery stores using computers to keep track
of their customers so as to target mailings isn't anything new.

I can't be the only person who wasn't allowed out of a Radio Shack store
until I gave my name and address...

And I always say "I'm on the mailing list already" and they always say "Well,
the computer will notice it and won't put you on again."

Problem is, my name is just complicated enough so that there's always just a
LITTLE bit of difference when it is keypunched, and the computer says "BING
BING BING not the same; add it to the list."

Steven C. Den Beste   (right. "Den Beste" complete with embedded space is my
            last name.)
Steven C. Denbeste, Steven Den Beste, Stephen Den Beste, Steven D. Beste,
Steven Dan Beste, Steven Beste, Steve Den Beste, Steven Baste,
and on and on and on. At one address I was on the damned list 5 times. And
since the Radio Shack mailing list never dies (they always say "or current
resident") some poor bastard is STILL getting those five catalogs every couple
of weeks.

The best comment of all may be that I received Steve "Pick a last name"
Den Beste's message *before* my copy of RISKS with my message arrived!

And if it is any consolation to Steve, in all the times I have shopped at Radio
Shack (albeit few times) I have yet to receive their catalogue in the mail.

A less-intrusive variant of this is already in place at my local Safeway.
After your purchase is rung up, a little printer on top of the cash register
spits out some coupons for you.  They always are for competing brands of things
similar to what you just bought.
