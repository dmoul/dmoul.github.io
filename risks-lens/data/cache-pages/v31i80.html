<h4>
EXCERPT:
</h4>
<p>
Today, we live in a world that is interconnected at an historic rate.  We
can directly interact with billions of people via phone, text, and email,
as well as assorted online platforms.  News is also abundantly available
through traditional TV, radio and print, as well as newer venues like
youtube and other online websites.
</p>
<p>
But what appears to be robust and permanent, is actually fragile and under
attack.  Messages that differ from the accepted narratives are being
deleted at an alarming rate, while those responsible for those message are
being demonetized and de-platformed.  People are also being shadow-banned,
resulting in their messages getting reduced visibility and circulation, all
without anyone's knowledge.
</p>
<p>
And it's not just the private networks either.  We know from governments
like China and revelations from Edward Snowden, that even more draconian
measures are possible.  Websites can be de-indexed from the search engines,
taken offline, or even replaced with fake versions.  Phone numbers and text
can be blocked, as well as entire cellular and Internet networks.
</p>
<p>
To circumvent these measures, here are a few options:

Every time you fire up your web browser your movements and browser history
are being leaked to various websites. No, I am not talking about cookies,
but about a technology that you may not have heard much about.  It is called
canvas fingerprinting.
</p>
<p>
In this post, I will tell you what it does and how you can try to stop it
from happening. Beware that the journey to do this isn't easy.
</p>
<p>
The concept refers to coordinating a series of tracking techniques to
identify a visitor using what browser, IP address, computer processor and
operating system and other details. Canvas is based on the HTML 5
programming interface that is used to draw graphics and other animations
using JavaScript. It is a very rich and detailed interface and to give you
an idea of the data that the browser collects without your knowledge, take a
look at the screenshot below. It shows my computer running Chrome on a Mac
OS v.10.13 using Intel hardware. This is just the tip of a large iceberg of
other data that can be found quite easily by any web server.

The coronavirus pandemic has brought air travel to an unprecedented
standstill—wreaking all sorts of havoc and putting countless jobs at risk
— but a new visualization is unlikely to make people eager to fly the
friendly skies again soon.

The motion graphic produced by Purdue University researchers shows the
aftermath of a single cough on an airplane, with tiny invisible droplets
dispersing throughout the cabin, possibly infecting a large number of fellow
passengers. […]

So, a number of us are at home, prevented from going to any of the normal
round of security conferences.
</p>
<p>
But we are creative and inventive people, and we know the tech.  So, why not
create our own?
</p>
<p>
I'm thinking the BSides model, trying to keep it as cheap (free?) as
possible, for the widest possible access.  (I'm thinking this because of the
notices I am receiving from various vendors who are trying to actually sell
their sales presentations, or combinations thereof, as conferences.)  (I may
be jumping the gun on that name/brand: I don't know who owns the BSides
model or brand, and while I highly respect it, I don't want to step on any
toes by simply assuming it.)
</p>
<p>
I'm thinking this is more than just a big Zoom meeting, or even a series of
Zoom meetings.

Dick Mills appears to understate the risks to the public from US elections,
whether the votes are cast online or not. Since the US Constitution does not
require that the popular vote be counted, it is the Constitution itself, not
the way in which elections are held, that constitutes a risk to the public,
who can be fooled into thinking that their vote is a form of participation
or a voice in government, when it is, in reality, merely an expression of
wishful thinking. An election in which a candidate who loses both the
popular and Electoral votes can still become President, is not a democratic
process that ensures meaningful public input or influence.

Rob Slade looks for details in the reports on the trial of Remdesivir
(Remdesivir works against CoVID-19!
<a href="https://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_1a62255cc20919cda25d487543ad9118">https://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_1a62255cc20919cda25d487543ad9118</a>) and I
agree that the message the data gives does need to be managed to ensure it
does not give a false sense of security.  Unfortunately Rob appears to have
missed one obvious point. The drug may not lower the mortality rate by much
(but as far as I am concerned any life saved is a significant bonus for that
individual, their family &amp; friends) but reducing the recovery time by 4 days
is absolutely crucial for a medical and care system that is heavily
over-loaded. If it can get people out of hospital 4 days earlier, freeing up
the bed and care professionals to treat somebody else who might otherwise
die for a lack of treatment, that is a game changer, a 'force multiplier'
for good.  disclaimer: I am not a healthcare professional (but my fiancee
is) nor do I have any connection with the pharmaceutical industry, except as
a satisfied customer.

Privately-owned vehicles converted from carbon-fuel to battery-driven
propulsion are apparently compliance-exempt from FMVSS 141, save for certain
conversions as noted. The NY Times piece identifies at least one company
that sells and conversion kits for classic VW models.
</p>
<p>
A battery-powered stretch-Humvee does not need to hum unless it wants to.
</p>
<p>
Here's the NHTSA's Office of Vehicle Safety Compliance (OVSC) response to my
inquiry on after-market vehicle conversions.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
  From: OVSCPublic@dot.gov
  Date: 06MAY2020
</p>
<p>
  Please note that the response provided below does not constitute
  authoritative legal advice. If you would like an authoritative answer,
  please request an interpretation from NHTSA's Office of Chief Counsel.
</p>
<p>
  Please also note that you may wish to consider the relevance of
  state/local laws and insurance policies.
</p>
<p>
  If this is a privately owned vehicle, and you are the owner, it is likely
  that modifications that you make do not fall under NHTSA's authority and
  would not need to comply with FMVSS 141 unless your modifications are
  extensive enough to make this a new vehicle (e.g. if an old body is placed
  on a new chassis). That being said, we would encourage vehicle owners to
  carefully consider whether vehicle modifications alter the vehicle in a
  way that might affect safety, and to take appropriate steps to ensure
  motor vehicle safety.
</p>
<p>
  NHTSA's enforcement authority applies primarily to entities such as
  manufacturers, distributors, dealers, and motor vehicle repair businesses
  rather than individual owners. If you are not the owner of the vehicle,
  you are likely to be considered such an entity. (In certain cases, you may
  also be such an entity even if you are the individual owner.) In such a
  case, we suggest seeking an interpretation from the Office of Chief
  Counsel or contacting the Compliance Assistance Program.
</p>
<p>
  The entities mentioned above are responsible for ensuring that vehicles
  comply with FMVSS that were applicable at the time of first sale - i.e.
  new vehicles. After first sale, such entities may not modify vehicles in a
  manner that knowingly makes inoperative part of a device or element of
  design that is required to maintain compliance with FMVSSs (see 49 USC
  30122). Consequently, a business modifying/repairing a vehicle would need
  to consider whether they are modifying the vehicle in a manner that
  maintains compliance with the FMVSSs that applied to the vehicle at the
  time it was originally manufactured. Additionally, the answer to your
  question may hinge on whether the vehicles you intend to produce are
  consider new or used. If they are considered used, then FMVSS 141 would
  likely not apply. If the vehicle is considered new (e.g. if an old body is
  placed on a new chassis), then FMVSS 141 would apply subject to the
  phase-in schedule detailed in 49 CFR 571.141 S9. The phase-in schedule
  applies to small volume manufacturers beginning on September 1, 2020.
</p>
<p>
  The Office of Chief Counsel has previously addressed correspondence
  similar to your question. Please note that these interpretations are being
  provided as a reference and may not be applicable to your specific
  circumstances:
