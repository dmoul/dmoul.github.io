A partial reply to Estell's nice piece on "Reliability, complexity
and confidence in SDI software" as well as other comments about
fault rates in large software:

(1)  The bathtub curve for reliability of engineered artifacts is usually
considered to be composed of three distinct phenomena,
    (i) The early failures caused by manufacturing defects,
    (ii) The "random" failures of components for "unknown" reasons
        (These may be judged as defects in the design, allowed
         to lower the cost of the product),
    (iii) Wearout failures near the end of the product life.
Type (i) failures give the initial declining failure rates during "burn-in",
type (ii) failures during the useful product life, and type (iii) failures
occur at the design-life limit.  This bathtub curve is not applicable to
software since the usual definition of a large software product includes
many different releases. Perhaps a software product should be compared to
several different models of the same car, toaster, airplane, etc.  The
bathtub curve describes the sum of manufacturing defects, design defects,
and wear.  Software ordinarily has no manufacturing defects and the
usual way ordinary backups are done insures that most software does not
wear out before it becomes obsolete.  Perhaps the Viking 1 Lander software
failure could be classified as a "wearout" due to inadequate preventative
maintenance, but this seems to be streching a point.
    So software ordinarily fails from design defects and design defects
only.  These are considered so important that we classify such defects
into specification, design and implementation defects.  The point here is
that none of these are manufacturing or wear failures.

(2) The defect rate models for software all attempt to describe a process
of redesigning the software after the discovery of failures, repeatedly,
in a never-ending cycle of testing (either formally or via users discovering
problems) and "maintenance" (which is actually redesigning a new model of
the software upon discovery of problems--with so-called enhancements
thrown in to confuse the issues).  I shall now give a crude approximation
to all of these models.  Let all realize I have abstracted the essential
features of these models to the point of unusability in QA practice.  The
essense is enough to make my point.
    We assume that the original release of the software has a load of
N design defects and that defects are discovered and instantly and
flawlessly reworked with a rate constant, a, according to the formula
    R(t) = N*exp(-a*t)
where exp() is the exponential function, t is a measure of software use
(time, person-years, cpu cycles consumed, ...) and R(t) is the remaining
number of design faults in the reworked software.  This formula clearly
illustrates that for any t&gt;=0, if R(t) is not zero, then more faults
remain.  In words, some faults mean yet more faults.
    The more detailed versions of this essential idea do, approximately,
describe the process of removing faults from a continuing sequence of
releases of a software product.  Bev Littlewood has a nice survey of these,
together with some practical suggestions, in a recent IEEE Trans.
on Software Engineering--perhaps last Jan or Feb issue.  In any case, we
may see that the essential feature of "some faults imply more faults"
is used in practice to estimate remaining design fault loads in
software.  The models have this feature because this seems theoretically
sound and the actual data is not inconsistent with this class of models.

(3) If faults are not repaired when discovered, there is data suggesting
that software failures may be viewed as type (ii), supra:  Singpurwalla
and Crow have a nice paper suggesting that faults are evidenced as
failures with a periodicity sufficiently good to make interesting Fourier
analysis of the failure data.  We may take this as suggesting that some failures
imply more failures at regular times in the future.

(4) Good designs have few faults and evidence few failures.  In software
this means few releases are necessary to correct faults.  However, many
software products interact primarily with that most flexible of
io devices, people, People quickly adjust to the ideosyncracies and
failures of the software they use.  In my opinion, Unix (Reg. Trademark,
AT&amp;T) and derivatives is successful because its ideosyncracies and failures
are somehow "human", but not because of low failure rates.
    Good software designs start with a low initial number of faults.
Good design practices seem to lead to better software.  But one simply
requires more data than currently exists to say much definite about the
advantages of Ada vs. a more traditional practice.  Furthermore, new
software is likely to be "more complex" than old software--leading to
perhaps the same MTTF.  Highly reliable software appears to be engineered
in much the same manner as any other highly reliable engineered artifact:
By repeatedly designing similar artifacts, obtaining experience with
their use, and then redesigning anew.

(5) Thus many of us are extremely dubious about the claims made for SDI
(and thus its driving software).  Without the ability to test in actual
practice, there is no compelling reason to believe any claims made for
the reliability of the software.  This point has been made several times,
by several people, on RISKS and I'll not repeat the argument.  It seems
that the onus of compelling evidence lies with those who claim SDI "will
work."  So far I've found no evidence whatsoever to support the claim
that ANY new military software works in its first adversarial role:  i.e.,
in the face of enemy action or a good, determined, simulation thereof.
I'd appreciate reliable evidence for such.  The claim for 100,000 line
programs which work reliably requires supporting evidence.  I am perfectly
prepared to believe that the 28th yadbm (yet another data base manager)
works reliably.  I'm not prepared to simply accept such claims for
military software.  An example:  JSS is a C3I system for the defense of
North America against bomber attack.  JSS is currently receiving some kind
of "independent operational" test in Colorado.  Workers at Hughes kept
careful records of defect rates during development, and reported that
certain of the standard models alluded to above failed to predict
defect rates at the next step of in-house testing.  Will I ever be able
to learn what the results of the "independent operational" test are?
I doubt it.  All I might be able to learn is whether the US adopts the
system or not.  I'm highly dubious about the reliability of JSS, despite
the adoption of reasonably current SE practices.  And recall, JSS is
the nth yac3i.

(6) Controlling complexity is a wonderful idea.  But what does one
do in the face of a truely complex world, in which complex decisions
must be made?  One designs complex software.  Recall that the Enroute
Air Traffic Control System has so far exercised only a minute fraction
of all the paths through it, despite being installed at about 10 sites
for about 10 years.  At the current rate one might get to 90% path
coverage by the year 2200?  Yet every time you fly on a commercial
aircraft, you implicitly trust this system.  I suggest you trust it
because it has been used operationally for 10 years and the enroute
controllers view it as trustworthy.  The fault rate is low enough
and the controllers flexible enough and the enroute mid-air near
collision rate is low enough that everyone is satisfied enough.  No
mathematics and little statistics here--just actual operational
experience.

(7) Software types need to adopt rather more of a Missouri attitude:
Show me that it works.  Part of the problem is defining what "works"
means.  Thats what makes the Viking Lander experiences so compelling.
Everyone can easily agree that the software worked the only two
times it was called upon to land the craft.  One might think that
military software experiences should be equally compelling to the 
senses.  So consider the Navy's Aegis experiences...   The result of
actual data suggests that SDI software is unbuildable as a highly
reliable program.  I repeat my call for serious, professional
papers on military software which worked the first time.  So far I
can only conclude than none such exist.  Thereby I think I am
entitled to discount any claims for the "quality" of military
software in actual, operational practice.  The logical, rational
conclusion is that, with no data supporting claims for military
software working in first use, and only data such as the Sgt. York
and Aegis, SDI software will not work the first and only time
it might be called upon to function.

Brian is quite right.  The job of an engineer is to build systems that
people can trust.  By this criterion, there exist few software engineers.

Brian Reid speaks eloquently to important issues.  Virtually
everything he says in this note makes perfect sense and should be
taken to heart by everyone designing systems.  BUT...

What he says now is not exactly what he said the first time;
when, I assure him, some of us were listening.  His first note
did in fact attribute blame, to the networking code and to the
student involved (under the general rubric of 'wizards').

The designer of the gelignite-handled screwdriver has clearly got a
responsibility when the screwdriver is (incorrectly) used to pound on
something and explodes.  The designer has little responsibility when the
screwdriver is used (incorrectly and maliciously) as a sharp object to stab
a co-worker during a fight.  If the screwdriver is used to hit someone over
the head in a fight, and explodes, the responsibility is a lot more muddled.
It is not at all clear how far the designer's responsibility for protecting
us from mistakes extends to protecting us from temptation.

Is a car manufacturer morally liable for its cars being capable of going 120
mph, creating the potential for more serious accidents when they are used
inappropriately?  Is the manufacturer of autodial modems responsible because
they make it possible for system crackers to try many more phone numbers per
hour than manually dialled modems?

Had Brian made slightly less attempt to de-jargonize his original posting
and said ".rhosts" instead of "permission files", which could refer to quite
a few different things ina BSD system, I would have taken a different
impression of his complaint away from that original posting.  I agree
strongly that .rhosts files are a danger that administrators should be able
to turn off, preferably on a host by host basis.

It should still be noted that .rhosts files are there for a reason and that
that reason is perfectly valid and the provision of .rhosts capabilities
perfectly reasonable IN THE APPROPRIATE SITUATION.  A campus-wide network of
machines under diverse administrators may not be such a situation; I would
hate to see the capabilities taken out of the system simply because there
may be inappropriate situations.  Ftp and telnet are still provided as well
as the r-utilities.

As our moderator has said, fault rarely lies on one head.  I agree with
Brian that the designer (of systems OR screwdrivers) has a strong
responsibility to consider both unintentional and intentional misuses of her
systems and to watch for aspects of her designs that could raise the
consequences of such misuses.  The strongest responsibility is to make the
limits of appropriate use obvious to the user, by packaging, documentation,
and whatever other steps may be necessary.  If on mature reflection it still
seems likely the user will be unaware of the problem (who reads
documentation on a screwdriver), the designer has a moral obligation to seek
other means to avoid misuse.  Perhaps the explosive screwdriver should be
sold only with with a two-foot long handle, making it unsuitable for common
domestic use, or as a separately packaged replacement handle in a six-inch
thick lead box bedecked with scenes of mutilation.  If, however, the object
is the best or only solution to a particular problem (only a gelignite
screwdriver can remove red kryptonite screws from lead doorframes), it may
also be morally unacceptable to suppress the product simply because it may
have dangerous implications in the hands of the unwary.

Hey, surprise, there's no easy answer...

       [Let me commend Brian once again for having performed a truly
        valuable service to the community.  (I notice his original message
        is reappearing in many places!)  I don't think we should expect him
        to try to respond to each such comment.  But — given the ease with
        which system and network security can be broken — we may see lots
        more of such analyses of OTHER breakins.  The sad part is that most
        of these vulnerabilities are well known in the security community,
        but few other people have yet been concerned enough to do anything,
        including most system developers.  The consensus among security folks 
        is that it will take a Chernobyl-like event in computer security
        before most people wake up.  PGN]

As I see it, you are all missing the point. A simulator *should* allow the
plane to land with the gear up. A simulator should allow it to release a
bomb in any position, *if the plane would*.  The simulator should not try
and stop the pilot from doing stupid things, it should react as the plane
would. *If the plane will not allow something*, then the simulation should
not allow it.

There is a difference. the *plane* should not allow a bomb to be detached if
it will damage the plane. *But if it does* the software should too.

<i>Sat, 27 Sep 1986 08:36 EDT</i>
<pre>
    From: Charles R. Fry &lt;Chucko at GODZILLA.SCH.Symbolics.COM&gt;
    No matter how many automated controls we install on cars (and airplanes)
    to prevent operators from exceeding their vehicles' limits, there will
    always be a need to allow the deliberate violation of these limits.  

This discussion about allowing overrides to programmed safety limits worries
me.  It is certainly true that there are instances in which the preservation
of life requires the operator to override these devices.  But these have to
be weighed against the situations in which a careless operator will go
beyond those limits when it is inappropriate.  I haven't heard much
discussion about that, and maybe it is because it is very difficult
(impossible?) for the safety machinery to tell when an operator is being
careless given the operative conditions at the time.

There is a tradeoff here that many have resolved categorically in favor of
people being able to override computers.  I think only competent and
sensible people people, under the right circumstances, should be able to do
so.  The problem is to find a mechanical system capable of making these
distinctions.  Thus, the comment that PGN omitted "[Chuck added an aside on
the value of high performance driving schools.]" was, in my view, crucial to
understanding the situation involved.  Maybe a partial solution would be to
allow only drivers who have passed courses at high performance driving
schools to override.
