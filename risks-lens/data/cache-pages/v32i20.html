<p>
San Diego was the first city to fully embrace the CityIQ technology, though
Atlanta and Portland did run pilot tests of the technology. San Diego
financed the smart lights—and 14,000 other basic LED lights—with a
plan that spread the payments out over 13 years, in such a way that the
energy savings from replacing incandescent lighting would cover the cost and
then some.
</p>
<p>
The CityIQ streetlights are packed with technology. Inside is an Intel Atom
processor, half a terabyte of storage, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi radios, two 1080p
video cameras, two acoustical sensors, and environmental sensors that
monitor temperature, pressure, humidity, vibration, and magnetic
fields. Much of the data is processed on the node—a textbook example of
“edge processing.” That typically includes the processing of the digital
video: machine-vision algorithms running on the streetlight itself count
cars or bicycles, say, or extract the average speed of vehicles, and then
transmit that information to the cloud. This data is managed under contract,
initially by GE Current, and the data manager owns any analytics or
algorithms derived from processed data.
</p>
<p>
Initially, at least, the data was expected to be used exclusively for
civic analysis and planning and public convenience.
</p>
<p>
But in August 2018, everything changed. That's when, while investigating a
murder in San Diego's Gaslamp Quarter, a police officer looked up and saw
one of the new smart streetlights. He realized the streetlight's video
cameras had a perfect view of the crime scene—one unavailable from the
various security cameras in the area.
</p>
<p>
“We had never seen a video from any of these cameras before.  But we
realized the camera was exactly where the crime scene was.” says Jeffrey
Jordon, a captain with the San Diego Police Department.
</p>
<p>
The police department reached out to San Diego's environmental services
department, the organization responsible for the lights, and asked if video
were available. It turned out that the video was still stored on the light
-” it is deleted after five days—and Current was able to pull it up from
the light to its cloud servers, and then forward it to the police
department.

</p>
<p>
The U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) have publicly exposed a Russian hacking tool. Russia's Main
Intelligence Directorate apparently used the “Drovorub” malware to penetrate
Linux-based computers, which Keppel Wood at NSA's Cybersecurity Directorate
said are pervasively employed by National Security Systems, the
U.S. Department of Defense, the defense industrial base, and the at-large
cybersecurity community. Steve Grobman at cybersecurity company McAfee said,
“Drovorub is a ‘Swiss Army knife’ of capabilities that allows the attacker
to perform many different functions, such as stealing files and
remote-controlling the victim's computer.“ The report on Drovorub is the
latest in a series of public disclosures by the U.S government targeting
Russian hacking operations ahead of the 2020 presidential election.

<p>
Researchers—who previously made the headlines earlier this year for
uncovering severe security issues in the 4G LTE and 5G networks—today
presented a new attack called ‘ReVoLTE,’ that could let remote attackers
break the encryption used by VoLTE voice calls and spy on targeted phone
calls.
</p>
<p>
The attack doesn't exploit any flaw in the Voice over LTE (VoLTE) protocol;
instead, it leverages weak implementation of the LTE mobile network by most
telecommunication providers in practice, allowing an attacker to eavesdrop
on the encrypted phone calls made by targeted victims.
</p>
<p>
VoLTE or Voice over Long Term Evolution protocol is a standard high-speed
wireless communication for mobile phones and data terminals, including
Internet of things (IoT) devices and wearables, deploying 4G LTE radio
access technology.
</p>
<p>
The crux of the problem is that most mobile operators often use the same
keystream for two subsequent calls within one radio connection to encrypt
the voice data between the phone and the same base station, i.e., mobile
phone tower.
</p>
<p>
Thus, the new ReVoLTE attack exploits the reuse of the same keystream by
vulnerable base stations, allowing attackers to decrypt the contents of
VoLTE powered voice calls in the following scenario.

Can police demand you unlock your phone if they want to examine it for
evidence? Courts in different states have given different answers to this
question, but New Jersey's Supreme Court has ruled that the answer is
yes. The court decided that a suspect can be forced to use his passcode to
unlock his phone.  Read in 9to5Mac:

<p>
On 26 MAR 2020, I initiated a freedom of information act (FOIA) request to
the US Health and Human Services (HHS) seeking historical FDA inspector
full-time equivalent allocation. The FDA's Office of Regulatory Affairs
(ORA) returned a response on 14AUG2020.
</p>
<p>
The FDA inspector corps assess product regulatory compliance from imports,
domestic and foreign manufacturers. They are field-deployed personnel. The
inspector corps align to FDA product lines.
</p>
<p>
Investigations trace to one of six FDA centers with jurisdiction over the
product lines:
</p>
<pre>
CBER—Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research
CDER—Center for Drug Evaluation and Research
CDRH—Center for Devices and Radiological Health
CFSAN—Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition
CTP—Center for Tobacco Products
CVM—Center for Veterinary Medicine

2019,122.6,323.6,219.6,875.9,11.6,98.9
</pre>
<p>
One can observe from this table that 2019 inspector FTE ranges from ~80% to
90% that of the “peak” FTE (~2016)., confirmation of fewer “cops on the
beat“ overseeing FDA-regulated product lines.
</p>
<p>
One can explore the FDA “enforcement reports” space using this URL:
<a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/ires/index.cfm">https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/ires/index.cfm</a><i class="shield fad fa-shield"></i><i class="fad fa-flashlight flashlight"></i>. Note: This tool
reports on enforcement action from 2012 to current. The FDA publishes an API
to access the full recall database.
</p>
<p>
The enforcement report reveals many more voluntary
manufacturer/supplier-initiated recalls than mandatory recalls initiated by
the FDA.
</p>
<p>
POST-RELEASE product line defect escape detection surveillance is clearly
operative. A further investigation to assess inspector FTE allocation and
voluntary/involuntary product recall frequency might prove instructive.

New Hampshire is touting itself as the first state in the country to
authorize flying cars, which is a bit of an overstatement.
</p>
<p>
Why it matters: The bill signed by Gov. Chris Sununu, dubbed ”the Jetson
law,” makes it legal for “roadable aircraft” to drive on the state's roads.
</p>
<ul><li>That's not the same as authorizing urban air taxis to fly above those
   same roadways, something only the Federal Aviation Administration can do,
   and remains a long way off.
</li></ul>
<p>
Yes, but: It's still an interesting development on the road to future
mobility.
</p>
<ul>
<li>It applies to small planes that can also be driven as cars.
 </li>
<li>A handful of companies are working on such flexible aircraft,
   including Terrafugia &lt;<a href="https://terrafugia.com/">https://terrafugia.com/</a><i class="shield fad fa-shield"></i><i class="fad fa-flashlight flashlight"></i>&gt;, Samson Sky

 </li>
<li>The law allows pilots to drive these aircraft to and from airports but
   prohibits landing or taking off on public roads.
 </li>
<li>Terrafugia and PAL-V both have operations in New Hampshire, and all
   three companies helped shape the legislation.

<p>
Greenland's ice sheet has melted to a point of no return, and efforts to
slow global warming will not stop it from disintegrating. That's according
to a new study by researchers at Ohio State University.  “The ice sheet is
now in this new dynamic state, where even if we went back to a climate that
was more like what we had 20 or 30 years ago, we would still be pretty
quickly losing mass,” Ian Howat, co-author of <em>the study
&lt;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-020-0001-2.pdf">https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-020-0001-2.pdf</a><i class="shield fad fa-shield"></i><i class="fad fa-flashlight flashlight"></i>&gt;</em> and a professor at
Ohio State University, said.
</p>
<p>
Greenland's ice sheet dumps more than 280 billion metric tons of melting ice
into the ocean each year, making it the greatest single contributor to
global sea level rise, according to Michalea King, the lead author of the
study and researcher at Ohio State University.  The ice loss has been so
massive in recent years, she said, that it has caused a measurable change in
the gravitational field over Greenland.  Ice melting in Greenland
contributes more than a millimeter rise to sea level every year, and that's
likely to get worse. Sea levels are projected to rise by more than 3 feet by
the end of the century, wiping away beaches and coastal properties.
</p>
<p>
Coastal states like Florida, and low-lying island nations are particularly
vulnerable. Just 3 feet of sea level rise could put large areas of coastline
underwater. Forty percent of the US population resides in coastal areas that
are vulnerable to sea level rise.  “There's a lot of places, like in Florida
especially, where one meter alone would cover a lot of existing land areas,”
King said. “And that's exacerbated when you get storms and hurricanes and
things like that, that then cause extra surge on top of a higher baseline.”
</p>
<p>
The study also found that the ice sheet is retreating in rapid bursts,
leading to a sudden and unpredictable rise in sea levels, making it
difficult to prepare for the effects.  The study used four decades of
satellite data to measure changes in Greenland's ice sheet. The authors
found that after 2000, the ice sheet shrank so rapidly that replenishing
snowfall would not keep up with the rate of melting from parts of the
glacier newly exposed to warmer ocean water, even if climate change were
reversed.  […]

A Tel Aviv engineering college is working on an AI/machine learning system
that they hope will be able to detect “vocal biomarkers” of a COVID-19
infection in a person's voice.

<p>
On one hand, it's a great idea if it actually works. But we all know that
machine learning systems are approximations. They guess right most of the
time if the samples you're testing are consistent with the data that you
used to train the model. Like the face recognition systems that misidentify
people of color as criminals, this system if put into use as proposed in the
article (at the entrances of schools to decide who is allowed into the
building) has the potential to ruin a lot of people's lives with false
positives and maybe even kill a few people with false negatives.

It seems that handling of nuclear weapons instills a certain measure of

that errors can and do happen, that caused operators to prefer the “don't

Mark Thorson &lt;eee@dialup4less.com&gt; expresses concern about the common
mismatches between sound and picture.
</p>
<p>
This is mostly likely an implementation issue in codecs. Digital video
codecs, to minimise bandwidth, mostly transmit differences between frames.
Sometimes the scene changes abruptly, and has to be re-sent in full, and
demolition briefly, the stream falls behind.
</p>
<p>
There are effectively two channels in a stream, video and audio. The obvious
thing to do is to try to catch up the video as soon as possible, and let the
audio stutter. Video is where most of the information is, surely?
</p>
<p>
It turns out humans notice glitches in audio, especially speech, far more
readily than in video. Audio is basically continuous, whereas video relies
on the human visual system interpreting a series of still images as
motion. We cope with dropped frames in video without noticing, unless there
are a lot of them, but we notice audio problems.
</p>
<p>
Various companies have had to discover this for themselves over the years;
it doesn't seem to be specified in the digital video standards. I suspect
the feeds Mark has been watching have some contributors with equipment that
still prioritises video over audio.

Synchronizing audio and video has been a problem since the advent of talking
motion pictures.
</p>
<p>
The audio and video in digital TV are encoded and decoded separately.  The
video codes are a lot more complex and decoding can fall behind.  There are
supposed to be sync codes to adjust the audio to match but that doesn't
always work.

I'd think a deep fake would have if anything better sync than normal video
since both streams are completely under the control of the fake maker.

That's been the web's “new normal“ for a while now, here's one I ran into

<ul>
<li>everyone uses doodle pools to schedule meetings,
</li>
<li>my e-mail client is set to display plain text messages,
</li>
<li>I received a message with a link to doodle poll,
</li>
<li>I follow the link only to find out it's to the last week's poll that's
  already closed (and that zoom meeting already took place).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Before complaining to the organizers I changed my mail client to html view
and checked the link there: lo and behold, it took me to the correct poll
for the next meting.
</p>
<p>
So look on the bright side: at least the “noscript” version of the website
is telling you it's defunct. The “no html” MIME part of an e-mail message
does not.
