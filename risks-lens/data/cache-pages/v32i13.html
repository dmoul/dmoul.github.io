Dan Sabbagh, <em>The Guardian</em>, 21 Jul 2020
</p>
<p>
Russia report reveals UK government failed to investigate Kremlin
interference.
&lt;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/21/russia-report-reveals-uk-government-failed-to-address-kremlin-interference-scottish-referendum-brexit">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/21/russia-report-reveals-uk-government-failed-to-address-kremlin-interference-scottish-referendum-brexit</a><i class="shield fad fa-shield"></i><i class="fad fa-flashlight flashlight"></i>&gt;
</p>
<p>
British government and British intelligence failed to prepare or conduct any
proper assessment of Kremlin attempts to interfere with the 2016 Brexit
referendum, according to the long-delayed Russia report.
&lt;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum">https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum</a><i class="shield fad fa-shield"></i><i class="fad fa-flashlight flashlight"></i>&gt;
</p>
<p>
The damning conclusion is contained within the 50-page document from
parliament's intelligence and security committee, which said ministers “had
not seen or sought evidence of successful interference in UK democratic
processes”.
</p>
<p>
The committee, which scrutinises the work of Britain's spy agencies, said:
“We have not been provided with any post-referendum assessment of Russian
attempts at interference”—and contrasted the response with that of the
US. […]  This situation is in stark contrast to the US handling of
allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, where
an intelligence community assessment was produced within two months of the
vote, with an unclassified summary being made public.”
</p>
<p>
Committee members said they could not definitively conclude whether the
Kremlin had or had not successfully interfered in the Brexit vote because no
effort had been made to find out.  “Even if the conclusion of any such
assessment were that there was minimal interference, this would nonetheless
represent a helpful reassurance to the public that the UK's democratic
processes had remained relatively safe,” the report added.
</p>
<p>
The cross-party committee noted that publicly available studies have pointed
to “the preponderance of pro-Brexit or anti-EU stories” on the Russia
Today and Sputnik TV channels at the time of the vote and “the use of
‘bots' and ‘trolls' on Twitter, as evidence of Russian attempt to influence
the process.
</p>
<p>
Committee members complained that when they asked for written evidence from
MI5 at the start of their inquiry, the domestic spy agency “initially
provided just six lines of text” prompting criticism from the committee.
</p>
<p>
It accused MI5 of operating with “extreme caution” and said its “attitude
is illogical” because the issue at hand was “the protection of the process
and mechanism from hostile state interference, which should fall to our
intelligence and security agencies”.
</p>
<p>
The keenly anticipated document was completed last October, but was sat on
by Boris Johnson before the general election and only declassified and
cleared for release by the prime minister in December.
</p>
<p>
It could not be released until No 10 had nominated Conservative members to
the committee, although its nominee for chair Chris Grayling was ambushed by
opposition members who voted instead for Julian Lewis.
</p>
<p>
Downing Street is expected to publish its own response shortly.

The current pace of human-caused carbon emissions is increasingly likely to
trigger irreversible damage to the planet, according to a comprehensive
international <em>study</em>
&lt;<a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2019RG000678">https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2019RG000678</a><i class="shield fad fa-shield"></i><i class="fad fa-flashlight flashlight"></i>&gt;
released Wednesday. Researchers studying one of the most important and
vexing topics in climate science—how sensitive the Earth's climate is to
a doubling of the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere—found that
warming is extremely unlikely to be on the low end of estimates.
</p>
<p>
These scientists now say it is likely that if human activities—such as
burning oil, gas and coal along with deforestation—push carbon dioxide
to such levels, the Earth's global average temperature will most likely
increase between 4.1 to 8.1 degrees Fahrenheit (2.3 and 4.5 degrees
Celsius). The previous and long-standing estimated range of climate
sensitivity, as first laid out in a 1979 report, was 2.7 to 8.1 degrees
Fahrenheit (1.5 to 4.5 Celsius).
</p>
<p>
If the warming reaches the midpoint of this new range, it would be extremely
damaging, said Kate Marvel, a physicist at NASA's Goddard Institute of Space
Studies and Columbia University, who called it the equivalent of a
*five-alarm fire* for the planet.  […]

<h4>
Executive Summary
</h4>
<p>
Europe can strengthen its digital sovereignty by creating a sovereign
European digital ecosystem that is democratically accountable to its
citizens. A digital ecosystem that observes European values such as
transparency, openness and privacy protection, even in its technical design,
can create a digital public sphere that offers fair terms of access and use,
strengthens the public debate and safeguards the plurality that forms a key
part of Europe's identity. This sphere would be open to everyone, both
within Europe and beyond—the key to Europe's digital sovereignty lies not
in isolationism but in the creation of ambitious alternatives.
</p>
<p>
The current coronavirus crisis has shone a light not only on how digital technology is increasingly penetrating every area of our lives, but also on just how dependent Europe has become on non-European platform operators. Europe is losing its influence over the digital public sphere at a time when it has taken on a central role in the continent's economic and social life. As well as diminishing Europe's economic competitiveness and thus the prosperity of European society, this poses a particularly serious threat to people's individual freedom and privacy and to Europe's democratic values. The time has come for both the member state and European Union levels to demonstrate the common political will to actively shape a digital public sphere that provides a basis for democratic debate, public opinion-forming and respect for European values, and to develop and establish an open European digital ecosystem that offers a genuine alternative. If incorporated into the special funding measures to overcome the coronavirus crisis, this European Public Sphere (EPS) can also provide a huge opportunity for European companies and start-ups, thereby helping to boost value creation in Europe.
</p>
<p>
This paper describes how a European Public Sphere can be established as an alternative European ecosystem, and sets out
the concrete measures that will be necessary in order to do so. These include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Design of a technology infrastructure for delivering the digital public
   sphere as a public service.
</li>
<li>
Formulation of a technology strategy characterised by modularity,
   interoperability, openness and transparency that enables continuous
   development and a diverse range of business models.
</li>
<li>
 Establishment of a governance entity such as a European Digital Agency or
   agency network, together with an alliance of European actors including
   content, service and infrastructure component providers, civil society
   initiatives and research institutions.
</li>
<li>
 Government funding coupled with European regulation to kick-start the
   establishment of an open, European digital ecosystem for the development
   and operation of the key technological components and products for a
   digital public sphere.
</li>
<li>
 Requirement for all the digital ecosystem's actors to adopt a <em>values
   by design</em> approach.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
These measures will enable the establishment of a trusted digital public
sphere for the citizens of Europe that puts European values first and that
facilitates cross-border services and a dialogue between people who live in
different countries and speak different languages.
</p>
<p>
Together with key partner France, and in conjunction with the European
Commission and European Parliament, the Trio Presidency of Germany, Portugal
and Slovenia can initiate the European Public Sphere as an ambitious,
pan-European development project. Provided that they receive the necessary
backing and financial support from government, stakeholders from the private
sector, culture, civil society and academia are ready to create an
alternative European digital ecosystem.

How does “unreasonable search” work when any agency can buy data from

</p><p>
US Customs and Border Protection can track everyone's cars all over the
country thanks to massive troves of automated license plate scanner data, a
new report reveals—and CBP didn't need to get a single warrant to do it.
Instead, the agency did just what hundreds of other businesses and
investigators do: straight-up purchase access to commercial databases.

CBP has been buying access to commercial automated license plate-reader
(ALPR) databases since 2017, TechCrunch reports, and the agency says bluntly
that there's no real way for any American to avoid having their movements
tracked. […]

</p><p>
Several people involved in the events that took down Twitter this week spoke
with <em>The Times</em>, giving the first account of what happened as a pursuit of
Bitcoin spun out of control.
</p><p>
OAKLAND, Calif. A Twitter hacking scheme that targeted political, corporate
and cultural elites this week began with a teasing message between two
hackers late Tuesday on the online messaging platform Discord.
</p><p>
“yoo bro,” wrote a user named Kirk, according to a screenshot of the
conversation shared with The New York Times. “i work at twitter / don't
show this to anyone / seriously.”
</p><p>
He then demonstrated that he could take control of valuable Twitter accounts
— the sort of thing that would require insider access to the company's
computer network.

For several years now, I have been an unpaid AARP (American Association of
Retired Persons) volunteer doing U.S. and California income tax returns.
Our clients do not pay for the service.  Their returns are filed
electronically over encrypted Internet connections.  Even before the returns
are filed, we print paper copies of their returns at the time of service for
them to take home.
</p><p>
We retain NO client data when we do taxes, not one piece of paper brought by
a client or generated by our volunteers.  If a client forgets to take all
paper, we contact that client to return to the facility to collect it.
Otherwise, the paper is shredded.
</p><p>
We ask our clients whether they want to be contacted by AARP regarding other
services, but we do not urge them to say “yes”.  We ask our clients whether
they want their tax returns made available electronically to other AARP
locations the following year to simplify data entry, but we do not urge them
to say “yes”.  We ask our clients whether they want their tax returns made
available electronically to other authorized free services authorized by the
Internal Revenue Service the following year, but we do not urge them to say
“yes”.
</p><p>
Overall, the AARP Tax-Aide service operates with strict rules protecting the
client's data.  Using those data for any purpose other than completing a tax
return is prohibited.
</p><p>
On top of all that, the state of California's Franchise Tax Board has a Web
site where taxpayers can enter their own data and file their returns
electronically for free.  California has very stringent laws protecting the
privacy of its residents.  The state is not in the business of selling
personal data.

The canton of Zurich provides free tax preparation software for private

you can download the software and do it offline on your own computer —
Windows, Mac, or Linux.  There the software can pick up and use last year's
data if you've kept it; and you generate PDF to print and mail the completed
tax forms.

The name of the software is “Private Tax”.  It works, and it saves time and
money for the tax office as well as for individual taxpayers.  I have a hard
time thinking of any down side to this.

That sounds reassuring, but is actually rather worrying.  Boeing found
problems with their software, then uncovered another problem when fixing the
first. So they reviewed all 1 million lines of code which resulted in
“increased robustness”.

If the review had not found any further problems then the result would have

</p><p>
And if they don't like what they see—they “fix” it? How many times are
new problems introduced when fixing (maybe) old ones?
</p><p>
Combine that with being rushed through the million lines. As you say, it's
not reassuring.

Probably junior programmers get this boring grunt work: senior programmers
get to do more interesting jobs, like writing new code!
</p><p>
I think it was IBM's OS/360 operating system that, after release,
consistently had several thousand bug fixes per month.  There are two
possible explanations for this phenomena:
</p><p>
(1) The software contained an infinite number of bugs
</p><p>
(2) Each month the programmers fixed 2,000 bugs and in the process
introduced another 2,000 bugs.

Tautologies often need to be pointed out.  Mathematics textbooks from
Euclid's Elements onward are full of them, but millions still buy them
because they are useful.
