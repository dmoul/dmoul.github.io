The *Toronto Sun* reported this morning that a computer bug is being
blamed for the fact that over 14,000 radiology reports were not printed
and sent to doctors. This occurred at a newly built hospital in the
Montreal area from 7 Jan 2004 until 17 Dec 2004!  The reports were not
destroyed, but because they were never printed, doctors did not follow
up with the patients. The reports included abnormal radiology results,
so some patients may have cancer and not know it.

I suspect that most patients assumed that if they heard nothing then
there was nothing to worry about.

  579 Quebec patients.]

CNN reports that "Comair, which flies an average of 30,000 people per day,
called off all 1,160 daily flights for both Saturday and Sunday. It will
resume a limited schedule Monday, Comair spokesman Don Bornhorst said. The
computer system Comair uses to book pilots for flights broke down, he said.
Comair could not pinpoint a reason for the computer crash and could not say
why there was no backup system."  [Comair flies flights in the eastern and
midwest US as Delta Express.]

<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/TRAVEL/12/25/flights.canceled/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2004/TRAVEL/12/25/flights.canceled/index.html</a>

Comair's web page admits that they are "currently experiencing computer
problems, resulting in cancellation of flights through December 26th, 2004.
This includes, but is not limited to, flights to/from Cincinnati, Ohio."

We shouldn't be surprised that computer failures (whether hardware,
software, a combination, or something else) is causing problems, but this is
the first case I can recall where it's caused an airline to cancel *all* of
their flights for days.

Between failures like this and the nasty weather in the midwest, I'm sure
glad to be home this holiday weekend!

  [A short squib in the Palo Alto California Sunday *Daily News* noted that
  the 30,000 passengers span 118 cities, although *The New York Times*
  article said 119.  Also of note were the USAir baggage-handling problems
  in Philadelphia, where an estimated 8 to 10 thousand luggage items piled
  up; USAir canceled 65 flights on Thursday, 176 on Friday, and 143 on
  Christmas Day, due to bad weather, sick baggage handlers in Philadelphia,
  etc.  PGN]

Ken Knowlton noted an article by John Sullivan in *The New York Times* Metro
Section, 12 Dec 2004 (PGN-ed here), that I somehow missed in my morning
musing/newsing that day.  Ken's comment: ``Here's a fantastic way to fix a
serious technical problem: change the location of the sensors that have
indicated it!''

Despite opposition, managers of the Salem nuclear power station managers
(second largest in the U.S.A.) are planning to restart operations after
discovery of a flaw in a critical recirculation pump first that helps cool
three reactors, just south of Wilmington, Delaware.  This flaw was first
noted in April 2003, when it was noted that seals were wearing out too
rapidly.  Then, in November 2004, an engineering team determined that the
steel drive shaft was probably cracked â€” and at certain speeds ``bangs like
a freight train.''  New Jersey's top regulator (which has no regulatory role
in Delaware) advises fixing the pump before restarting the shutdown Hope
Creek reactor, which had to be shut down on 10 Oct 2004 because of a broken
steam pipe.  Sensors were added to the pump that showed lower vibration
readings than historical records, although those sensors were in different
places than those producing earlier diagnostics (which had previously showed
an almost doubling in vibrations between 2000 and 2002!).  The operators are
concluding that the pump is now safe (without having had any repairs).  The
state regulators are recommending replacing the bent drive shaft, but the
final decision is up to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

The December 2004 issue of "Modern Railways" reports a series of incidents
with the Pendolino electric trains, which earlier this year began operating
at 125 mph on the West Coast Main Line in England.

In one case, with the train moving at about 7 mph, the driver attempted a
normal brake application to bring it to a stop just short of the end of
track as usual â€” but it did not slow.  By the time the emergency brake had
been applied, there wasn't enough track left, and the train rammed the
buffer stop at 4 mph.  This was repeated a few days later.  Another case
involved a SPAD (signal passed at danger) after all axles on the leading car
locked up as the train approached the red signal: the speedometer read 0
while the train was moving.  The driver released and reapplied brakes, but
could not stop in time.

As on many modern electric trains, the conventional friction braking on the
Pendolino is supplemented by regenerative braking: the train's motors become
generators, feeding much of its kinetic energy back into the power supply
for use by other trains.

In this case the choice of braking mode is made by computer control.  When
the train is moving at speed, a normal command for brakes activates the
regenerative braking first, with the friction brakes added as braking demand
increases.  But the train only has motors on 1/3 of its axles, so the
regenerative braking is more prone to slipping in poor rail conditions, and
it can take up to 6 seconds for the computer to balance everything and reach
the desired braking level after a normal brake application.  So at lower
speeds, when even a light brake application might be intended to stop the
train in a short distance, the friction braking is brought on immediately.
(Presumably emergency braking also does this, although the article doesn't
actually say.)

The manufacturer, Alstom, had used this "braking and traction package"
successfully on other trains; the problem with the Pendolino (or maybe just
with this particular version â€” there are Pendolinos in other countries) was
simply that the speed threshold for immediate friction braking had been
lowered from 20 to 7 mph, and that was too low.  It looks to me as though
someone just didn't understand the way that trains are driven at low speeds.

Last weekend's catastrophic failure of bank card readers and cashpoints
across Belgium was caused by a chain of small technical errors and not a
computer virus, it has been discovered.  "(A)n unfortunate sequence of minor
hiccups in the internal Banksys system was aggravated by the large number of
bank card payments made by shoppers."

220K bank card transactions failed as did 60K credit card transactions
representing 20M Euros.  Banksys announced that all transactions will be
free on 18 December as a measure of consideration.  "But it is still denying
overall responsibility for the blunder."

According to www.lexpress.fr (the website of a leading French news
magazine), today's date is Jeudi 23 dÃ©cembre 104.  The date is
generated by the following snippet of ECMAScript:

  var tj= new Array("Dimanche","Lundi","Mardi","Mercredi","Jeudi","Vendredi","Samedi");
  var tm= new Array("janvier","f&amp;eacute;vrier","mars","avril","mai","juin","juillet","ao&amp;ucirc;t","septembre","octobre","novembre","d&amp;eacute;cembre");
  d= new Date() ;
  document.write( tj[d.getDay()] + " " + d.getDate() + " " + tm[d.getMonth()]  + " " + d.getYear()) ;

One wonders how long this has been so, and how much longer it will
take before they realize that they need to add 1900 to the year (and
start reading manuals).

<a href="http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/realdata/sightings/cities/index.cgi">http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/realdata/sightings/cities/index.cgi</a>
-- which allows you to pick a city and find out when there will be an pass

This week the header at the top of the pages reads "THE FOLLOWING ISS

Fortunately, the only a risk would be using the same logic for calculating a

Rice University Computer Scientists Find a Flaw in Google's New Desktop
Search Program

By John Markoff, *The New York Times*, 20 Dec 2004
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/20/technology/20flaw.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/20/technology/20flaw.html</a>
[Also noted by Jim Schindler; PGN-ed]

Rice University professor Dan Wallach and two of his graduate students, Seth
Fogarty and Seth Nielson, have discovered a potentially serious security
flaw in the desktop search tool for personal computers that was recently
distributed by Google.  The flaw could allow an attacker to clandestinely
search your PC via the Internet.  This is an example of a composition

Researchers warn of multiple unpatched Windows holes;
Vulnerabilities could leave systems open to remote attacks

Paul Roberts, IDG News Service, 24 Dec 2004

Symantec Corp. warned its customers about a number of critical holes in
Microsoft Corp.'s Windows operating system that surfaced late yesterday and
that could make Windows systems vulnerable to compromise by remote
attackers.  Symantec acted after security researchers published the details
of the heap overflow vulnerabilities in messages posted to online security
news groups Thursday, including the Bugtraq mailing list, and on
xfocus.net. The flaws affect most supported versions of Windows, but
Microsoft has not yet issued a patch for the newly disclosed holes. Windows
users are vulnerable to Internet based attacks until patches are issued,
Symantec said.

Three Serious Windows Vulnerabilities Surface,
David Morgenstern, eweek.com, 24 Dec 2004

Symantec Corp.'s Security Response service on Friday confirmed that
unpatched Windows vulnerabilities could pose a serious risk for exploits via
malicious Web pages and e-mail messages.  One of the three security
vulnerabilities involves image handling-a source of recent exploits on
Windows and Unix operating systems. The other two risks are found in the
Help system and in Window's ANI (Automatic Number Identification)
authentication.  Symantec said the Microsoft Windows LoadImage API Function
Integer Overflow Vulnerability could be exploited via browsers or e-mail
client software. Users who open an HTML message or Web page bearing the
image could face security risks.  ...

Exploits released for new Windows flaws
Robert Lemos, CNET News.com, 23 Dec 2004

A Chinese security group has released sample code to exploit two new
unpatched flaws in Microsoft Windows.  The advisory comes in the week before
Christmas, a time when many companies and home users are least prepared to
deal with the problems. Security firm Symantec warned its clients of the
vulnerabilities on Thursday, after the Chinese company that found the flaws
published them to the Internet.

One vulnerability, in the operating system's LoadImage function, could
enable an attacker to compromise a victim's PC when the computer displays a
specially crafted image placed on a Web site or in an e-mail. The other
vulnerability, in the Windows Help program, likewise could affect any
program that opens a Help file.  ...

leave enumerating the risks as an exercise for the reader.

<address>
&lt;"Don Norman" &lt;norman@nngroup.com&gt;&gt;
</address>
<i>Tue, 21 Dec 2004 22:07:45 -0800</i><pre>

In <a href="/Risks/26/30">RISKS-26.30</a>, Peter Neumann recommended a paper by Scott Sagan entitled:
"The Problem of Redundancy Problem: Why More Nuclear Security Forces May
Produce Less Nuclear Security" <a href="http://cisac.stanford.edu/publications/20274/">http://cisac.stanford.edu/publications/20274/</a>

I want both to second the recommendation and also to expand upon it.  Many
attempts by both experts and amateurs in the world of security and safety
actually weaken their systems.

Sagan provided three major reasons why this might be so: I add a
fourth. Sagan's three reasons were:

1. Common-mode problems. Adding redundancy only makes things more secure or
safe if the new items are truly independent of the existing ones. They
seldom are, and accident after accident demonstrates the common mode
problem, where one accident takes out all the supposedly redundant
system. (Classic example: redundant hydraulic lies in a DC-10, but an
accident destroyed the part of the fuselage that held all three
lines. Poof. No more hydraulics.)

2. The "shirking" problem (also known to psychologists as "bystander
apathy").  The more people that are asked to check upon a system, the less
thorough any individual is apt to be. Think about it â€” will you take extra
steps to check something if you know that "n" people have already vetted it
and "m" more will do so after you? But if everyone shirks their duty, the
reliability goes to zilch. In Social Psychology, "bystander apathy" refers
to the experimentally validated observation that the more people that
witness a crime, the less likely it is to be reported.

3. The overcompensation problem.  This can be phrased as "the system is now
safer, so I can take more risks" problem. Make a system more safe or more
secure and people learn they can take chances. Add seat belts in automobiles
and people drive faster. Add a secondary limit detector on a mechanical
system, and people are willing to go beyond the first limit ("because the
backup will catch any problem").

I want to emphasize the importance of these problems, while adding an equally
important fourth one:

4: The Dedicated Worker problem.  If the security or safety requirements get
in the way of doing the work, then the most dedicated workers will defeat
them. Put in locked doors, and they will prop them open with waste
baskets. Require long, lengthy, hard-to-guess passwords, changed frequently,
and they will write them down and post them in easy to reach places.  After
all, security and safety are risks, not realities (and usually
low-probability at that.(*) Getting the work done on time is a reality, and
these extra steps invariably make it harder to do the work. Hence, the most
dedicated workers will remove whatever tends to block getting the work done.

------- (*) This is what I have sometimes called the "one in a million"
problem. Low probability events are often judged to be non-existent, or at
least, that happen to others. I've named it after the pilot who decided that
all three of his engines could not be failing because "the chance of this
happening is one in a million."  My observation is, "yes, you are correct,
and you are that one."  Actually, with some 7 million flights a year, one in
a million is not nearly good enough, but that is a different argument.

------- Item one of these four is a technical issue: the other three are
psychological ones. When attempting to increase security and safety of
systems, it is essential that the psychology of the people be considered to
be of equal or greater importance than the purely technical analysis. Note,
the most obvious response of security and safety people is "more training is
necessary."  Yes, proper training is always useful, but don't count on it
solving these problems.  These issues happen despite training. They often
are present in the best, most well motivated, most effective people in the
organization. Indeed, professionals in the security and safety industry have
succumbed to just these issues. ("I know my home computer isn't secure, but
it was absolutely essential that I finish this report, ..."). The correct
solution lies in ensuring that the security and safety measures take into
account both the technical and the psychological factors.

There are many services that depend on GPS so shutting it down in a national
crisis appears to be foolhardy. On the other hand, a GPS unit trivializes
the development of a guidance system. For example,
<a href="http://www.buzzle.com/editorials/6-3-2003-41208.asp">http://www.buzzle.com/editorials/6-3-2003-41208.asp</a> discusses how
inexpensive it is to build such a system. I'm sure that there are plenty of
other applications that risks readers can think of that use GPS for guidance
that might, indeed, be the basis for future attacks in the US or elsewhere.

I recall that Richard Feynman found a similar issue with the storage of
radioactive material in adjacent rooms.  Neither room had a dangerous mass
of material, but when the material is stacked back-to-back on the same wall
in different rooms, it was possible for the mass to become critical.

DJ&gt; Now some websites don't even allow browsers from lesser countries

... like the U.K., in the George W. Bush case ...

DJ&gt; countries to connect. "Who from there would need to read our
DJ&gt; website? They're all just spam bots."

The problems of determining country from the IP address of the connecting
client are known, of course, although less well than they should be, it
seems.  IP addresses simply don't map reliably onto countries.  Most
approaches rely upon tables derived from coarse-grained data, and are thus
either inaccurate or incomplete.  For example: Dan Bernstein provides an
example DNS service that returns different answers depending from the
continent (It doesn't even aspire to determining the specific country.) of
the client (strictly: the resolving proxy DNS server) performing the lookup.
Perform a "TXT" lookup for "clientcontinent.cr.yp.to." to see it in action.
The service is based upon the 2001 IANA IPv4 address space allocation list.
Even accounting for the datedness of the source data, there are vast swathes
of IP address space for which it cannot even determine the *continent* of
the client IP address.  One might blame the coarseness of the IANA source
data, but finer grained approaches suffer from other problems, such as
errors caused by address assignment churn.  And that's not to mention other
factors such as VPNs, caching proxy servers, and the cases, common in years
gone by although less so today, of people who make international calls for
PPP access.

And of course, there are always the humourous consequences of people
trying to determine country from IP address.  *The Register* covered the
George W. Bush website block, for example, and noted that Canada was
deemed to be part of the United States by the Bush Campaign.

Chapter one lists twenty tips for using a number of utilities and
programs to enhance the security of UNIX systems.  The explanations
are clear and specific, although you would probably have to be really
familiar with UNIX administration to get the full benefit of these
suggestions.  Windows gets ten hacks in chapter two.  While useful,
these could have had more explanation in some cases, in regard to the
limitations and pitfalls of the recommendations.  Almost all of the
network security tools discussed in chapter three are for UNIX,
although some do have Windows versions.  The same is true with the
logging tips in chapter four, although there is mention of arranging
to have Windows report to a syslogd.  Network monitoring, and some
analysis thereof, is in chapter five.  Tunnels and VPN (Virtual
Private Network) products are detailed in chapter six.  Most of the
network intrusion detection material in chapter seven concerns Snort.
(You are not my NIDS, you are a Snort!)  Chapter eight lists a few
recovery and response tools.

If you run a UNIX system and network, this book enumerates many useful
tasks, settings, and tools that will help to make your systems and
network more secure.
