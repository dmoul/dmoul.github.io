The dichotomy between errors of commission and of omission is reminiscent of
the tension between negative and positive control in launch-on-warning
systems.  Clearly, negative control is a snap if one is willing to
compromise positive control: there is perfectly reliable negative control
whenever the system is shut off.  That is, errors of omission are not
possible if one is willing to accept errors of commission in this case.
Obviously, there is a continuum of possibilities between this extreme and
the extreme of just launching without any reliable detection whatsoever;
this is the only region of interest.  The point illustrated is that the two
classes of error are not likely to be independently controllable; there is a
built-in tension between them.

   I haven't seen anybody mention that there does seem to have been an
"error of commission" in the operation of the range safety system after
the Challenger explosion (specifically, the destruction of the SRBs).
Of course this is a human rather than a computer error, but the result
is the same; the system as a whole functioned less than optimally.

   I understand that even NASA now admits that the SRBs were not in fact
endangering anything at the time that they were destroyed.  But I do
understand how there must be an almost irresistible temptation for the
range safety officer to do the "safe" thing (in this case, destroy the
boosters).  Perhaps this is the inevitable result of having humans making
these decisions (error on the side of safety).

   I'm not sure that anything can really be done about this, except to
provide extensive training and an adequate supply of information on which
to base the actual decisions.  Do the range safety officers have access
to real-time flight-path projections and similar information that would
allow them to make intelligent decisions?

     Martin J Moore queries why the shuttle destruct system should be
tested more extensively against errors of commission (error causes
destruct system to activate) than against errors of omission (error
causes destruct system to be unable to activate).  The reason is that
for the errors of omission, the rest of the system serves as an
additional link, ie., for an error of commission to cause disaster,
ONLY the destruct system has to fail.  For an error of omission to cause
disaster, the destruct system has to fail SIMULTANEOUSLY with the vehicle
failing.   Thus, the most probable event is for an error of omission to
gail "safe": the vehicle wouldn't have blown up if somebody wanted it to,
but nobody wanted it to, so it didn't matter.

Here at Purdue's Engineeering Computer Network, we've had "synchronized"
time on all our machines for some time.  For a long time, all the machines
ran "datesync", a program which checked a central machine every N minutes
(usually 15 or 30) and set the local machine's date and time according to
what it got from the central host.  There were some minor sanity checks, but
nothing fancy.  We never had too much trouble, since if the central machine
came up with the wrong date you could get it reset before the other machines
came and got their time information.

A couple of years ago, we plugged a Heathkit (Al)Most Accurate Clock (WWV)
into the central machine.  It used to be set off "George's Watch".  This
made stuff somewhat better — when the central machine came up, it got the
time from WWV instead of "datesync"ing to another machine.  The WWV software
was used periodically (every 15 minutes, I think) to adjust the central
machine clock.  Except for the time when the someone unplugged the WWV clock
and then a few days later it's battery backup freaked out, we have NEVER had
a serious problem with the "datesync" scheme (20 machines or so).

Well, with 4.3BSD UNIX you get this neat toy called the "time daemon".  It
handles network clock synchronization off a master machine by doing various
clock adjustments (rather than hard-setting the clock, it actually diddles
the clock speed).  It has all these neato sanity checks and SUPPOSEDLY it
won't let a preposterous time come in.  In fact, you even see this stuff on
the console once in awhile that says "PREPOSTEROUS TIME ....".  Sounds neat,
right?

Well, last month all the machines on the network decided that it was 4:00pm,
January 4, 1985.  Somehow this slipped right by all the sanity checks, and
the master time daemon stuffed it into one machine.  Then it PROPAGATED it
to all the other machines.  Having horribly wrong time can be fairly
catastrophic on a UNIX system — the "cron" utility starts up all sorts of
programs based on the time of day and day of the week.  Including things
like "find all files older than X and delete them".  We were less than
amused...  Another brain-damaged feature of the time daemon — if you set
the date on ONE machine, it BROADCASTS that information through the time
daemons to ALL the machines.  You better PRAY you never mistype the date!

The thing that really bugs me about this stuff is that it's so simple to make
it more bullet-proof (not fool-proof, necessarily).  For example, just plain
IGNORE any date which changes your date by more than X unless you are
explicitly told TAKE THIS DATE REGARDLESS.

Well, this letter is already twice as long as I intended, so I'll shut up
now...  things like this are an interesting subject though — I wonder how
much other software in computerdom just blindly assumes that some
"authority" is correct.

In addition to its other bugs (e.g., null timestamps), our mailer puts a
control character at the beginning of each user's personal name.  This arises
from keeping the personal name as a counted string but displaying it as
ordinary text; the control character is the count byte.  Recently I have
received messages (ranging from polite to nasty) from several RISKS readers
telling me that my control character causes their terminals to reset, go into
graphics mode, or do other unpleasant things.  I can't do anything about it;
we're waiting for a fix from the vendor, and we're stuck until we get it.
Since you edit my headers to get the date right, would you mind flushing the
control character also?

      [I took it out of the FROM field.  But this problem reminds me that
       many of our readers may not have never heard of the old problem of
       squirreling away control characters and escape sequences in messages
       which when read can wreak havoc with an unsuspecting mail reader,
       especially one with an intelligent terminal having redefinable keys.
       If that problem has not been fixed on YOUR system, dear reader, YOU
       may be running at great risk.  PGN]

One of the origin of risks in any system is exemplified by the discussion of
the Canadian effort at "vocalizing" the value of a currency note. I do not
have any information in addition to what has been posted in the RISKS digest
(so feel free to correct me if I am wrong), but there seems to be nothing in
the original posting [<a href="/Risks/2/28">RISKS 2-28</a>] to indicate that the aim of the device is
to dectect/reduce forgeries. Yet, the first argument offered against it is
the ability to fool it.

My interpretation of the device is one to help a blind person "read" the
currency note SOMETHING THAT HE CANNOT NOW DO--- not to tell him if the
currency note is valid or a forgery! Risks of such a system come from the
public putting more faith or expecting more from a system than its stated
goal.

As a side issue, there is no reason to think that fooling such a device
would be any different than fooling change machines that are commonly found
around here, which detect at least the difference between 1$ and 5$ bills.
There is no reason why such a machine could not be connected to a voice
synthesizer to speak out the amount. Addition of speech capability in itself
does not increase the risks/unreliability/foolability(?)  of any system.

           [Just don't trust it with anything larger than what you are
            willing to be cheated out of.  You may have noticed that you
            don't see change machines for $100 bills.  There are good
            reasons.  PGN]
