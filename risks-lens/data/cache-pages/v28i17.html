There is a lot of unenlightened opinion doing the rounds about IOActive's
discovery, reported at Black Hat recently, of vulnerabilities in Cobham's
Aviator 700 and 700D SATCOM systems, some of it propagated by Black Hat
reviewers (comment by Iozzo reported in
<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/04/us-cybersecurity-hackers-airplanes-idUSKBN0G40WQ20140804">http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/04/us-cybersecurity-hackers-airplanes-idUSKBN0G40WQ20140804</a>
) and some of it by IOActive themselves (see their White Paper at
<a href="http://www.ioactive.com/pdfs/IOActive_SATCOM_Security_WhitePaper.pdf">http://www.ioactive.com/pdfs/IOActive_SATCOM_Security_WhitePaper.pdf</a> )

Direct from the UK comes word of one of the more dubious medical experiments
I've heard of in some time, that should raise ethical red flags around the
world.

If you live in the Welsh, West Midlands, North East, South Central and
London Ambulance Service areas, and you take no action to opt-out from a
planned new University of Warwick study—and you're unfortunate enough to
have a heart attack—you may randomly find yourself treated with a placebo
rather than the conventional treatment of adrenaline. If you die from your
heart attack, researchers will not actively seek out your relatives to
inform them of how you were treated.

Persons who happen to see advertisements about the study in those areas and
so learn of its existence can in theory opt-out --otherwise, you're a lab
rat whether you want to be or not.

Researchers have a legitimate question—does adrenaline therapy in these
situations do more harm than good? Unfortunately, in their attempt to avoid
study bias, they have violated a basic informed consent principle of ethical
experimentation.

I suspect that this study stands a good chance of collapsing in the light of
publicity, and the litigation potential appears enormous even for the UK. If
nothing else, I would expect to see campaigns urging UK residents in the
affected areas to opt-out en masse.

I would opt-out if I lived there.

Sometimes ostensibly "good science" is unacceptably bad ethics.

Not much to say: the problem has been known for a long time (the referenced

  "The amount of routes TCAMs can store is finite, as a post on The IPv4
  Depletion Site blog, ran by a group of network and IT experts,
  explains. While workarounds have been developed to deal with this limit,
  not all routing equipment (especially older routing equipment) has been
  upgraded to use them. On Tuesday morning, the Internet felt a very
  distinct tremor that resulted from the size of the routing table reaching
  that magic number of 512,000 BGP routes. BGP is the protocol used to
  communicate routing information."

NOTE: The "magic number" is undoubtedly "512K" (where K = 1024), which is
better known as 524,288.

Bryce Covert, Think Progress, 12 Aug 2014 (via Dave Farber)
&lt;<a href="http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2014/08/12/3470204/women-pushed-out-engineering/">http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2014/08/12/3470204/women-pushed-out-engineering/</a>&gt;

Nearly 40 percent of women who get a degree in engineering don't end up
making it in that career, according to new research presented at the
American Psychological Association convention.

These women either never enter the field at all or end up leaving. Eleven
percent never got an engineering job to begin with, while 21 percent left
more than five years ago and 6 percent left less than five years ago. Of
those who leave, “poor workplace climates and mistreatment by managers and
co-workers are common reasons,'' according to the release. Two-thirds of
those who left less than five years ago found a better opportunity in
another field while a third stayed home with their children because their
companies couldn't accommodate their caregiving needs. Of those who left
more than five years ago, 17 percent cited their caregiving duties and 12
percent said they didn't have an opportunity for advancement.

“These findings are likely to apply to women working in fields where there
are less than 30 percent women,'' said Dr. Nadya Fouad of the University of
Wisconsin-Milwaukee, who presented the findings, in a release. That makes
them “more vulnerable to being pushed out because they typically aren't in
the internal `good old boys' network.''

But the secret to keeping women isn't tough to figure out. The women who
stayed in engineering jobs cited supportive bosses and coworkers, paths for
advancement, and the ability to balance work and life. “The reasons women
stay with their engineering jobs are very similar to why they leave --
advancement opportunities and work climate,'' Fouad said in the release.

The research notes that women have made up more than 20 percent of
engineering school graduates over the past two decades, yet just 11 percent
of engineers are women. Generally, women make up 41 percent of graduates
from science and engineering programs but only about a quarter of the
workers in the science, technology, engineering, and math (or STEM)
fields. And the steady march of progress has recently stalled. Most of the
growth for women under 40 entering these fields happened between the 1970s
and 1990s, but it's tapered off since then.

That may be in part because women are leaving the field at a high rate. They
are 45 percent more likely to leave a STEM job a year in than men. Women and
black people with advanced STEM degrees are more likely to end up with a job
outside the field than white men.

Work/life balance is one thing that gets in the way. Women in STEM are less
 likely than men to have children at home: 62 percent don't have kids,
 compared to 57 percent of men. That's likely a sign that children are an
 obstacle to women staying in the field in a way that they aren't for
 men. Women may also be facing outright discrimination. Science professors
 see their female students as less competent than their male ones even when
 they have the same accomplishments and skills. Both genders are twice as
 likely to pick a man for a math job than a woman.

about a "second leaker":

The Intercept article focuses on the growth in U.S. government databases of
known or suspected terrorist names during the Obama administration.

The article cites documents prepared by the National Counterterrorism Center
dated August 2013, which is after Snowden left the United States to avoid
criminal charges.

Greenwald has suggested there was another leaker. In July, he said on
Twitter "it seems clear at this point" that there was another.

Everyone's miscounting. This is the third leaker:

   - Leaker #1: Edward Snowden.
   - Leaker #2: The person who is passing secrets to Jake Appelbaum, Laura
   Poitras and others in Germany: the Angela Merkel surveillance story
   &lt;<a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/gchq-and-nsa-targeted-private-german-companies-a-961444.html">http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/gchq-and-nsa-targeted-private-german-companies-a-961444.html</a>&gt;,

   My guess is that this is either an NSA employee or contractor working in
   Germany, or someone from German intelligence who has access to NSA
   documents. Snowden has said that he is not the source for the Merkel story,
   and Greenwald has confirmed that the Snowden documents are not the source
   for the X-KEYSCORE rules. I have also heard privately that the NSA knows
   that this is a second leaker.
   - Leaker #3: This new leaker, with access to a different stream of
   information (the NTSC is not the NSA), whom the *Intercept* calls "a
   source in the intelligence community."

Harvard Law School professor Yochai Benkler has written an excellent

So, in 2010, former DIRNSA Mike McConnell (From Feb 28, 2010, *The

“[The United States must] develop an early-warning system to monitor

and we must be able to do this in milliseconds.  ...

We preempt such groups by degrading, interdicting and eliminating their
leadership and capabilities to mount cyber-attacks, and by creating a more
resilient cyberspace that can absorb attacks and quickly recover.

I was surprised to see the original Wired piece omit any mention of the
DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge effort, now ramping up (they've made some awards
to competitors), which is for a fully automated "capture the flag"
exercise,i.e., autonomous systems, without human intervention, conducting
defense (and attack) to win a bot-on-bot-on-other-bots competition.

<a href="http://www.darpa.mil/cybergrandchallenge/">http://www.darpa.mil/cybergrandchallenge/</a>

Personally, I think if you've got to trust that an automated system will
"hack back" in faster-than-human cycles, you're playing with fire.

The Cyber Grand Challenge is about automatically finding weaknesses, and
automatically generating fixes. It is not about creating attacks (though,
like most tools, its discoveries could feed into an offensive system).

But the general point is well taken - taking humans out of the loop in an
offensive weapons system is ethically questionable, and can go horribly,
horribly wrong. There's a reason booby traps are illegal everywhere, and the
world is finally giving up landmines.

Way back in 1983, in the movie 'War Games', the driver for the plot was the
removal of humans from the loop for responding to a Soviet ICBM
attack. Needless to say, this Did Not Go Well. The failure mode wasn't that
unrealistic either; during the Cold War both the US and SU's defenses
misidentified events as attacks, and if human approval wasn't required,
might have started WW3.

We're now seeing vigorous debate over the ethics of deploying LAWS (Lethal
Autonomous Weapon Systems, aka 'killer robots'). What's being proposed is
the cyber equivalent. Snowdon in the referenced article, points out what all
of us in the field already know: That its often very difficult to find a
correct attribution for a cyber attack. If (hypothetically) a Russian
government hacking group attacked US systems through servers located in
China, would 'MonsterMind' start a US attack on Chinese systems? In the
short term, fatalities could ensue if the apparent source controlled vital
systems. In the long term, how would China react?

  the removal of humans from the loop for responding to a Soviet ICBM
  attack.

It goes back earlier than War Games.  For many of us, the canonical example
is Dr. Strangelove.

I can imagine some variation such as this occurring at Cyber Command:

General Jack D. Ripper: Mandrake, do you recall what Clemenceau once said
about war?

Group Capt. Lionel Mandrake: No, I don't think I do, sir, no.

General Jack D. Ripper: He said war was too important to be left to the
generals. When he said that, 50 years ago, he might have been right. But
today, war is too important to be left to politicians. They have neither the
time, the training, nor the inclination for strategic thought. I can no
longer sit back and allow Communist infiltration, Communist indoctrination,
Communist subversion and the international Communist conspiracy to sap and
impurify all of our precious bodily fluids.

We can't afford a cyber mineshaft gap, can we?

SUMMARY: In a new interview, Snowden explained how fears of an accidental
cyber-war, together with concerns over surveillance of U.S. citizens' web
traffic, turned him into a whistleblower.

Wired's James Bamford interview of Snowden: &lt;<a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/08/edward-snowden/">http://www.wired.com/2014/08/edward-snowden/</a>&gt;

The U.S. developed a cyberwarfare tool called MonsterMind that would
automatically `fire back' if it thought it detected an attempted attack on
the U.S., NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden has revealed.

In an interview published Wednesday in Wired, Snowden also said an
intelligence officer had told him the U.S. was responsible for the 2012
disconnection of Syria from the Internet, albeit by accident. He also said
the U.S. had “crossed lines'' by attacking civilian infrastructure in
China.

MonsterMind

MonsterMind seems to have been one of the triggers for Snowden's decision to
blow the whistle, along with the construction of a massive new data storage
facility in Bluffdale, Utah.

The tool was, according to Snowden, partly designed to look for Internet
traffic patterns that could denote incoming cyber-attacks, and to block such
attacks. However, it would also “automatically fire back, with no human
involvement.'' This raises serious ethical implications because attacks are
often routed through other countries, making it possible that automated
counter-attacks could target the wrong people, perhaps civilian facilities
such as hospitals.

Snowden also expressed discomfort with the implications of MonsterMind for
U.S. citizens communicating outside the country, telling reporter James
Bamford: “The only way we can identify these malicious traffic flows and
respond to them is if we're analyzing all traffic flows—that means we
have to be intercepting all traffic flows. That means violating the Fourth
Amendment, seizing private communications without a warrant, without
probable cause or even a suspicion of wrongdoing.''

Syria and China

When Syria briefly dropped off the Internet in late 2012, it was widely
assumed to be the doing of President Bashar al-Assad—the country was,
after all, descending into civil war. ...

FYI—If the U.S. govt claims to care so much about protecting American
citizens from cybercriminals, then it must stop these cowboy NSA
shenanigans, else the cyberwar version of "Perl" Harbor will likely be
friendly fire from our very own NSA.

It is precisely ham-handed mistakes of this sort that worries all of us
about any attempts to weaken encryption.

Jacob Kastrenakes, Aug 13 2014
An elite hacking unit broke a router
<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/8/13/5998237/nsa-responsible-for-2012-syrian-internet-outage-snowden-says">http://www.theverge.com/2014/8/13/5998237/nsa-responsible-for-2012-syrian-internet-outage-snowden-says</a>

When Syria's access to the Internet was cut for two days back in 2012, it
apparently wasn't the fault of dissenting "terrorists," as the Syrian
government claimed: according to Wired, it was the fault of the US
government.  In a long profile of Edward Snowden published today, Wired
writes what Snowden says is the truth about the Internet outage.  An elite
hacking unit in the National Security Agency had reportedly been attempting
to install malware on a central router within Syria—a feat that would
have allowed the agency to access a good amount of the country's Internet
traffic.  Instead, it ended up accidentally rendered the router unusable,
causing Syria's Internet connection to go dark.

The NSA reportedly attempted to repair the router and cover its tracks, but
the agency was unable to do so.  Until now, however, it appears that no
evidence of the NSA's tampering actually came out.  It's a pretty dramatic
change in the storyline, as it had been widely assumed that the outage had
been caused by one of the warring parties within Syria, be it the government
itself or rebels.  Syria's Internet has gone dark a number of times since
then, so it isn't unreasonable to continue assuming that there are other
parties at play when outages occur.  Snowden's report describes an
embarrassing blunder for the US though, and it'll certainly open up the list
of culprits that people will consider should similar incidents occur in the
future.

InfoWorld, Cloud Computing, 11 Aug 2014 Here are four cloud horror stories
along with spoilers, so you can make it out alive.  What happens when a
cloud provider declares bankruptcy?  Late last year, a cloud storage company
called Nirvanix shut down and gave customers only a few weeks to move data
to a different provider.  According to Charles King, an IT analyst, this
meant companies with terabytes or even petabytes of data in the cloud had to
act quickly.  "A business should always have a strong sense of the assets it
has stored in the cloud, but it needs to consider those points in terms of
the time and cost of retrieving them," King says.

In the case of Nirvanix, one client noted that, due to the company's
download bandwidth limitations, it would need 27 days, in a best-case
scenario, to recover all data. "That was cutting things pretty close since
they were given just 30 days' notice to remove everything," King says.

  [Note: The Nirvanix case was discussed in <a href="http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/27/49">RISKS-27.49</a>, almost a year ago.

Amid push for cash-free tolling, conscientious objectors stand strong

Martine Powers, *The Boston Globe*, 13 Aug 2014

Suzanne DeLesdernier is part of a small but stubborn group of
Massachusetts drivers who decline to order an E-ZPass, the state's
electronic toll transponder—not because they do not know where to obtain
one, or because they do not have a bank account, but because they do not
agree with electronic tolling.

Some of the reasons for their intransigence include: They are concerned
about government surveillance. They are apprehensive about erroneous fees
charged automatically to their credit cards. They disapprove of eliminating
good jobs held by toll takers for decades.  And they would miss the small
social exchanges with toll takers, the face-to-face contact, as they pass
over their fare.

<a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/08/12/amid-push-for-cash-free-tolling-conscientious-objectors-stand-strong/qsyXsJ8GrEnXYJfSny3EHI/story.html">http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/08/12/amid-push-for-cash-free-tolling-conscientious-objectors-stand-strong/qsyXsJ8GrEnXYJfSny3EHI/story.html</a>

(I sort of find the last reason hard to believe, but I do understand
the elimination of jobs aspect).

The rebuttal analogy fails since a doctor is comparable to an architect or a
structural engineer in the construction trade, not to a bricklayer.  An EMT
(Emergency Medical Technician) would be a more fitting parallel in the
healthcare domain: an EMT who needs to dress a shallow wound and apply some
iodine to it does not need to attend six years of medical school to perform
the task, a basic first aid training will suffice.  It would be great to
have all medical professionals get a MD degree (and the quality of resulting
service would undoubtedly rise) but then the cost of healthcare would be
even more stratospheric.

There is a spectrum of software engineering tasks and the article seems to
make the point that at the low end of that spectrum the tasks can be
accomplished by someone with vocational training, while the percentage of
high end tasks that _require_ (meaning can not be accomplished to a
satisfactory level without) a CS PhD or decades of experience are rather
limited. Ordinary CS grads with some experience would then occupy the
middle, breezing through the low end tasks and struggling when faced with an
assignment beyond their depth. Web site development in particular often
amounts to nothing more than installing Wordpress, enabling a fitting set of
plugins, importing content and applying the design-- none of which are
classic "programming", and none of which require a CS degree to perform
well.

The WSJ is correct; programming is a trade.  Just like investment banking
is a trade, that needs no education, training, or experience.  After all,
people with all of those things get it right no more often than people who
have no such skills (e.g., compare index investing to "active" investing).
Investment banking is just entering trades into a computer screen, right?

So will the WSJ be advocating replacing all of the high-priced bankers with
high school students with a couple weeks of training in how to use trading
systems?

No?  Didn't think so.

You will get no argument from me that the underlying risks that this alleged
discovery is being used by all and sundry to illustrate are both real and
important. However, I still find the specific claims made by Hold Security
to be somewhat implausible (laundry list of reasons, amply cited
elsewhere). The further claims advanced by NYT that "a security expert not
affiliated with Hold Security analyzed the database of stolen credentials
and confirmed it was authentic" and that "another computer crime expert who
had reviewed the data, but was not allowed to discuss it publicly, said some
big companies were aware that their records were among the stolen
information" frankly do nothing to dispel my suspicion; may in fact increase
it. I see no names mentioned in the NYT article. Why would either of those
"experts" remain anonymous? They might be under NDA covering forensic
specifics, but that would hardly extend to their own identities.  That
anonymity prevents us from examining both their qualifications and the
contention that they are unaffiliated with Hold.

&gt; Why do you immediately rule out the obvious and completely effective fix of
&gt; having Google stop conducting what appear to be searches of my private
&gt; e-mail for potential criminal activity? ...

There's a very simple reason why not: Google isn't scanning every e-mail
message for child porn. It isn't even scanning them for spam. It is scanning
them for targeted advertising, which is where it gets its money from. Spam
detection, or child porn detection are the side-effects.

"Stop Google from scanning e-mail" == "stop Google from making money" "shut down Google".

Behind the door #2 is: "let Google keep conducting searches of my private
e-mail and doing what they will with some of the patterns they find; have
them stop doing some of those things with some of those patterns.  For
example, reporting potential criminal activity to law enforcement agencies,
that's a big no-no."

I'm sure I don't have to spell out what's wrong with this picture.

PS—now that I read Dan's entire speech:

Google is doing exactly what Dan says they should do. They inspect the
content, that makes them "responsible for that content if it is hurtful".
"Forty-eight States vigorously penalize failure to report sexual molestation
of children" and "the U.S. Code says that it is a crime to fail to report a
felony of which you have knowledge".

Therefore if Google didn't report kiddie porn sitting in a gmail account to
the feds, Google would be committing a crime.

Now, Dan's alternative is may not be available in real life: you'd have to
find a non-surveillance state where non-content-inspecting providers like
Lavabit are allowed to exist, in the case of Google whose business is built
on content inspection, they are doing the right thing.

Has anyone brought up the fact that the some of the hashes in the database
can be for things that require search warrants?  There is sure to be a path
that gives the details of where the hash match was found entities that are
not going to use the information for child pornography prosecution.

Some examples:
 1. hashes for copyrighted material.
     MIGHT be illegal, should need warrant
 2. corporate documents
     MIGHT be illegal, but should need warrant
 3. "love notes" probably not illegal, but may be
    useful in civil cases. (my evidently not-so-special other sent a
    message to someone not me; I have the text, but
    I don't know where it really went.)
