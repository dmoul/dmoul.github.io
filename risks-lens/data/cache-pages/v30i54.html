Hackers from the Dutch intelligence service AIVD have provided the FBI
with crucial information about Russian interference with the American
elections. For years, AIVD had access to the infamous Russian hacker
group Cozy Bear. That's what de Volkskrant and Nieuwsuur have uncovered
in their investigation.

[Googling the subject line also gets you to the Volkskrant article.  Volks
is people in Dutch, so Volkskrant might be The People's Voice or something
like that.]

Cynthia McFadden, William M. Arkin and Kevin Monahan, NBC News, 7 Feb 2018,

The U.S. official in charge of protecting American elections from hacking
says the Russians successfully penetrated the voter registration rolls of
several U.S. states prior to the 2016 presidential election.

In an exclusive interview with NBC News, Jeanette Manfra, the head of
cybersecurity at the Department of Homeland Security, said she couldn't talk
about classified information publicly, but in 2016, "We saw a targeting of
21 states and an exceptionally small number of them were actually
successfully penetrated."

Jeh Johnson, who was DHS secretary during the Russian intrusions, said,
"2016 was a wake-up call and now it's incumbent upon states and the Feds to
do something about it before our democracy is attacked again."

"We were able to determine that the scanning and probing of voter
registration databases was coming from the Russian government."

NBC News reported in Sept. 2016 that more than 20 states had been targeted
by the Russians.

There is no evidence that any of the registration rolls were altered in any
fashion, according to U.S. officials.

TheÂ European Research Group on Environment and Health in the Transport
Sector (EUGT), with automaker funding, performed these tests.

&gt;From the BBC article:

    "Were the tests unethical?"

    'The German government thinks so. VW apologised and Daimler said
    "the EUGT's approach contradicts our values and ethical
    principles."'

    "In the end, the EUGT, which was disbanded in 2017, concluded that
    no health effects could be detected. Diesel emits more particulate
    soot than regular gasoline, as well as pollutants such as nitrogen
    dioxide and nitrogen oxides that in the short term, the EPA says,
    can lead to respiratory ailments and exacerbate asthma.Â 

Industry sponsored research is fine when full disclosure of all
findings are presented, especially those affecting public health and
safety. Often, negative results (or outliers; tail events) are
suppressed to accentuate the positive. Industry-sponsored research
findings from pharmaceuticals, implantable devices, etc. are prime
examples. Takata airbag ignition shrapnel is another. A mighty long
list in this space.

Transportation systems appear as a ripe target for unethical research
practices. Given a historically low air transport fatality rate,
certain organizations might be tempted to "push the envelop" on reduced
qualification efforts to save funds, and justify their effort using one
or more academic studies that sponsor confirmation bias or bury risks.
Another nail in the coffin of public trust.

Every so often I encounter someone who says that their life is an open book,
and that anyone who is concerned about Panoptic government surveillance or
uses encrypted messaging must have something to hide.

My short response is often to express sympathy for them having such boring
lives.

Now we have a real world example of a NATO government persecuting 75,000
innocents as part of a Witch Hunt.

Many thousands of innocent Turks were pursued by their government after
viewing webpages that had a 1x1 1 pixel link to Bylock.net.

Other consequences included loss of jobs and suicidal depression.

  'BeÅŸikÃ§i said it was due to a single line of code, which
  created a window "one pixel high, one pixel wide"â€”essentially invisible
  to the human eyeâ€”to Bylock.net.'

Usually we don't do this during rush hour, says Ben Shukman. He's driving a
Lincoln MKZ sedan, trying to exit a gas station driveway and cross four
lanes of traffic so he can make a left at the light 20 yards ahead. It's 5pm
in Palo Alto, and Silicon Valley commuters are crawling home, leaving few
gaps between the cars. Finally, the car in the closest lane stops, leaving a
space for him. The car in the next lane over does too. Shukman slides in and
makes the left.

Good job, Ben, says Shai Magzimof, giving a wave of thanks to those gracious
humans. He's sitting in the driver's seat, while, in a garage miles away,
Shukman controls the Lincoln from the kind of setup you'd find in the
bedroom of a too-serious fan of racing video games. And he's showing off the
type of remote-control capability that every major player in the nascent
world of robotic driving will end up relying on (at least for now) in some
form or other.

  In May, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
  will officially go into effect. The GDPR is ostensibly a law to protect
  the privacy of European citizens when it comes to how Internet
  megacorporations like Google and Facebook handle their data. But the
  privacy regulations also come with some secondary effects whose influence
  extends far beyond the borders of the EU and ironically may actually serve
  to undermine the security of Internet users, rather than protect them.

This situation is total bull. You want a domain name? You should be publicly
and fully identified, unless you can present some compelling case of why
doing so would be dangerous to you. Otherwise, it should be like a business
license or other public record. I'm tired of spammers, phishers, and other
goddamned crooks hiding under the hypocrisy of "privacy"â€”and the EU is
now complicit in those crimes.

How Strava's "anonymized" fitness tracking data spilled government secrets
Analysis: Strava may "anonymize" the user, but that isn't helpful when that
user inadvertently reveals the location of sensitive government facilities.

opening text:

Remember when you said you have "nothing to hide?"

It turns out you do. If it's not an affair you're hiding from your spouse,
it's your highly classified place of work that's now painted in precise
detail on a map for anyone to see.

That's exactly what happened when Strava, a widely used app for tracking
activity and exercise, released an "anonymized" heatmap of all its global
data in November. The map only came to light this weekend after Australian
student Nathan Ruser started digging into the data.  With over 3 trillion
coordinates at the street level from over 27 million fitness device users,
like Fitbit and Jawbone, the GPS tracking company mapped out its aggregated
data over the past two years of activity to reveal some of the most visited
areas.  Predictably, high population areasâ€”like most of the US and Europe
-- are brightly lit up.

That same data also illuminated a scattering of little-known locations in
war zones, where US secret facilities and military bases have operations and
personnelâ€”presumably because soldiers and staff are unknowingly uploading
their fitness tracking data to Strava.

The news has prompted US-led coalition forces to reevaluate their use of
fitness trackers, amid fears that enemy forces could use the data to locate
troops on the ground, according to a statement obtained by the Washington
Post.

Mountain View CA.  More than half the U.S. adult population was a victim of
cybercrime last year, according to a new study by *Norton*.  All told, 143
million Americans lost a total of $19.4 billion , as well as an average of
19.8 hours dealing with the aftermath. Globally, cybercrime victims tended
to use the same password across multiple accounts or share it with
others. What's more, 39% of victims said they gained trust in their ability
to protect their data and personal information from future attacks, and 33%
believed they had a low risk of becoming a cybercrime victim.  Despite a
steady stream of cybercrime sprees reported by media, too many people appear
to feel invincible and skip taking even basic precautions to protect
themselves, said *Fran Rosch*, the executive vice president of Symantec's
consumer business unit.  This disconnect highlights the need for consumer
digital safety and the urgency for consumers to get back to basics when it
comes to doing their part to prevent cybercrime. Forty-six percent of U.S.
cybercrime victims owned a smart device for streaming content, compared with
about one quarter of non-victims. They were also three times as likely to
own a connected home device.

How We Define Cybercrime

The definition of cybercrime continues to evolve as avenues open up that
allow cybercriminals to target consumers in new ways. Each year, we will
evaluate current cybercrime trends and update the report's methodology as
needed, to ensure the Norton Cyber Security Insights Report provides an
accurate snapshot of the impact of cybercrime as it stands today. In the
2017 Norton Cyber Security Insights Report, a cybercrime is defined as, but
not limited to, a number of specific actions, including identity theft,
credit card fraud or having your account password compromised.  For the
purposes of this report, a cybercrime victim is a survey respondent who
confirmed one or more of these incidents took place.  Visit
<a href="https://www.symantec.com/about/newsroom/press-kits">https://www.symantec.com/about/newsroom/press-kits</a> to learn more.

  ...which doesn't say what sort of account password had to be compromised
  to be a cybercrime. I've been alerted that some accounts were likely
  compromised but since they were inconsequential and didn't share passwords
  with anything else, I needed and took no corrective action. So I might be
  counted as a victim, I didn't spend a secondâ€”let alone the alleged 19.8
  hoursâ€”doing repairs. And summary doesn't explain how they reached
  conclusion of $172B losses.  **

The automaton was following all the rules, and it seems that in this case
the motorcyclist was a bit out of line; this may satisfy the lawyers, but

"Important! For the noindex meta tag to be effective, the page must not
be blocked by a robots.txt file. If the page is blocked by a robots.txt
file, the crawler will never see the noindex tag, and the page can still
appear in search results, for example if other pages link to it."

  I wonder what an analogy in human terms might be.

  "If you put a Do Not Disturb sign on your door, you still have to leave it

Ms. Smith [pseudonym], CSO,  5 Feb 2018
The EternalSynergy, EternalRomance, and EternalChampion exploits have been
reworked to work on all vulnerable Windows versions: Windows 2000â€”Server
2016.

[selected text]

Oh, good, three NSA exploits previously leaked by The Shadow Brokers have
been tweaked so they now work on all vulnerable Windows 2000 through Server
2016 targets, as well as standard and workstation counterparts.

The reworked NSA exploits work on all unpatched versions, 32-bit and 64-bit
architectures, of Windows since 2000. Dillon included this list of supported
versions of Windows that can be exploited: [snipped list of 43 items]

Researchers Neil Gandal, JT Hamrick, Tyler Moore, and Tali Oberman have
written a fascinating paper on Bitcoin price manipulation. Entitled Price
Manipulation in the Bitcoin Ecosystem, and appearing in the recent issue of
the Journal of Monetary Economics the paper describes to what degree the
Bitcoin ecosystem is controlled by bad actors.

* Author's opinion - it is highly unlikely that Tether is growing
through any organic business process, rather that they are printing in
response to market conditions.
* Tether printing moves the market appreciably; 48.8% of BTC's price
rise in the period studied occurred in the two-hour periods following
the arrival of 91 different Tether grants to the Bitfinex wallet.
* Bitfinex withdrawal/deposit statistics are unusual and would give rise
to further scrutiny in a typical accounting environment.
* If there is questionable activity, the author believes a 30-80%
reduction in BTC price could be forecast.

Following the publication last year of the data collected by Windows 10's
built-in telemetry and diagnostic tracking, Microsoft today announced that
the next major Windows 10 update, due around March or April, will support a
new app, the Windows Diagnostic Data Viewer, that will allow Windows users
to browse and inspect the data that the system has collected.

Windows 10 has two settings for its data collection, "basic" and "full."
The documentation last year described all the data collected in the "basic"
setting but only gave a broad outline of the kinds of things that the "full"
setting collected. The new app will show users precisely what the full
setting entails and a comparison with what would be sent with the basic
setting.

New pattern matching tech takes aim at predicting how long new hires will
stay, potentially saving employers billions per year. But has AI really
cracked the code on employee retention?

CIO, 24 Jan 2018

interesting quote:

Polli says, "Maybe 50 years ago, jobs were more similar across different
companies. Potentially, the world was less complex. But I think nowadays
there's just so much variability in what someone would call any given role
that I think it's hard to just say, 'Oh, look for these three things and
you're all set.'"

But looking for key traits is exactly what her company does. When this
reporter took Pymetrics' tests, I scored high in "risk preference for high
risks," "risk preference for low risks," and "planning speed." My results
listed these as negative traits for an entrepreneur, predicting I only had a
6 percent chance of making it as one for more than a year: I'm a two-time
tech founder who sold her first company for a multiple of revenue after
running it nine years.  And speaking as a tech founder, these so-called
negative traits helped me do my job.

  I can see all too easily questionable models being used in hiring.  I
  already see questionnaires when applying for some jobs that have many
  ambiguous questions and when I have asked, I have been told to fill it out
  the best I can.  Turning AI loose in the area has the potential to be much
  worse.

"First, we kill all the lawsuits."
-- Apologies to W. Shakespeare

Statesâ€”including Californiaâ€”are falling all over one another to lead
the country in boosting autonomous vehicles, perhaps to prove that they
welcome investments in building factories.

But the first order of businessâ€”other than obtaining financial subsidies
-- seems to be securing "safe harbors" against "frivolous" lawsuits that
might arise out of unpleasantness caused by less-than-optimal autonomous
vehicle behaviors.

Now I'm not a big fan of class-action ambulance chasers, but in the
application of a new technology, tort law may be the only protection society
has against egregious and negligent behavior by greedy "unicorns".

Unfortunately, we are systematically disconnecting the backup system of
tort law BEFORE the primary system of regulation has been installed and
activated.

Not that this behavior is at all new.  Theodore Vailâ€”as CEO of ATT --
made a deal with society that ATT would be shielded from all kinds of
lawsuits in return for being heavily regulated as a monopoly.

More recently, the drug industry is shielded from litigation, as
responsibility was shifted to the FDA for drug regulation.  But we must not
put the hearse before the autonomous cart.

In spite of military assurances, autonomous weapon research speeds ahead
The US Army has successfully paired autonomous vehicles with robotic weapons.

Autonomous vehicles are coming to roads near you. If the US Army has its
way, battlefields will be next.

Under a program nicknamed "Wingman," the Army just announced it is range
testing autonomous vehicles equipped with robotic weapons systems. So far,
engineers have managed to successfully destroy targets with a self-driving
Humvee equipped with an onboard autonomous 7.62 mm weapon system.

The three-year program officially began last year, and it seems to be
progressing quickly.

"You're not going to have these systems go out there like in 'The
Terminator'," Thomas B. Udvare, deputy chief of the program, told the Army
News Service. "For the foreseeable future, you will always have a Soldier in
the loop."

Nice to hear. But there's something a little spooky about the Army insisting
humans will remain in the loop while engineers are rushing ahead with
weapons systems clearly designed for autonomous use.

I suspect I know that flyover ...

But I got bit by a very similar sort of issue. The Embankment in London was
closed by roadworks a few days ago. So Google, detecting no traffic, thought
it was the perfect route and was directing people to use it.  Unfortunately,
as the name implies, this runs alongside the Thames, so drivers' options for
a diversion once they realised they were in a jam were extremely limited. I
ended up going back to Westminster Bridge (I think it took me an hour to
travel a net zero metres) before crossing south of the river and heading to
my destination that way.

Surely it's not beyond the wit of computer to realise that if ALL the
vehicles you are directing down a certain road all divert off, that there's
something wrong? Rather than, as at present, you send even more traffic that
way to turn a jam into gridlock.

The Governor of Hawaii is declaring that the long delay in his sending out
the "false alarm" message after an incoming missile alarm was triggered in
error, was due to his not knowing his own Twitter credentials. He had to
find his public communications spokespersonâ€”who normally ran his Twitter
accountâ€”in order to get an "all clear" note out on Twitter. Supposedly he
now knows his own username and password. I wonder if he has 2-factor
enabled?

  The Hawaii Emergency Management Agency "button pusher" who sent a bogus
  missile alert that triggered panic across the islands on Jan. 13 is not
  cooperating with either a Federal Communications Commission investigation
  nor two internal investigations.

One wonders if the President's nuclear football has a similar
"Are you sure you want to destroy mankind? (y/n)" UX?

Perhaps 2-factor authentication is warranted?

They're more than countersâ€”when they scan my boarding pass I can see that
it shows my name and my seat number.

Apparently the passenger did have a boarding pass for another flight so the
obvious question is whether each scanner is supposed to accept bp's for a
single flight, or all the scanners in the airport are the same and they'll
all accept bp's for any flight and the staff are supposed to check that it's
showing the right flight number.

Ahem.  Patent and copyright are not the same thing.  Independent creation,
i.e., I made my white noise all by myself and not by listening to your white
noise, is a complete defense to claims of copyright infringement.

  [Absolutely.  TNX.  PGN]

By the way, the actual answer to the question about the prime number is no,
since there is case law saying that copyright requires creativity, and the
amount of work involved doesn't matter.  The case involved copying
phone-book white pages (remember them?) listings.

  [Incidentally, in that courts have ruled we cannot copyright our own
  genomes, "creativity" cannot be the sole factor.  Cheers! PGN]
