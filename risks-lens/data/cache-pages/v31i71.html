Thousands of alleged email addresses and passwords linked to organizations
battling the coronavirus pandemic prominent have been dumped on the
Internet, where they almost immediately were used to foment hacking attempts
and harassment by far-right extremists.

constraints.

<p>
A revered global brand, Denmark's Lego has generously contributed their
expertise and facilities to manufacture and donate personal protective
equipment (PPE). Lego has pledged US$ 50M for pandemic relief efforts.
</p>
<p>
This example of corporate generosity from a trusted brand raises an
important risk. Lego makes toys. The pandemic has compelled a humane
business decision to become PPE suppliers, almost overnight.
</p>
<p>
The USA Today article does not discuss factory health and safety
certification or compliance standards. Apparently, one must assume that you
can “Bet your life on Lego.”
</p>
<p>
Must Lego PPE satisfy ISO and other important/essential standards? Are the
PPE recipients equipped to perform receiving inspections and verify fitness
for use? Where are the inspection results? Are the inspectors qualified? Has
a manufacturing or inspection waiver been granted given the emergency? Under
whose authority? Is industrial regulatory compliance mandatory under
pandemic conditions for PPE?
</p>
<p>
If the PPE is faulty, patients and healthcare personnel will be at greater
risk of infection.
</p>
<p>
Reports about ineffective coronavirus test kits, substandard personal
protective equipment (PPE), and global shortages are noteworthy. See:

Israel's Ministry of Health distributes such an application, which seems to
be using something similar Google's Timeline to backtrack confirmed infected
people and warn app holders who had come in contact with them.
</p>
<p>
I have downloaded this application, and indeed received a warning that I had
been in the vicinity of an infected person, and have to go into isolation
for up to 14 days from the moment of contact. The only problem was that I
got the warning on the 13th day, with less than 12 hours left of the
isolation time!
</p>
<p>
In an environment where it may take several days for an infected person to
show symptoms, a few more days to wait for an inspection, and a few more
till the results are in, the whole idea becomes a sad joke.  The long delay
also makes using proximity technology like Bluetooth useless, unless <em>all</em>
contacts between any two people, infected or not, are recorded and kept in a
database to be checked later if any of them is found to have been infected.

<p>
I belatedly learned that the proposed app defined a “contact” as a user to
have remained within 1.5 metres of another user (one of whom had marked
themself as “infected”) for 15 minutes.
</p>
<p>
Although this would very largely avoid the “passing by” and “loose dog”
scenarios I postulated, it raises other questions.
</p>
<p>
Whilst the potential to be infected by another person rises by exposure
duration and proximity, one expulsion of virus-laden droplets immediately
upon “contact” can be sufficient to cause infection.  The 15 minute
“exposure” seems a wholly arbitrary time.  And what if the “contact” is
broken—possibly by a signal dropout or just that the parties moved more
than 1.5 metres apart—within that time, but then resumed, does the clock
reset?  Could I spend several hours in a meeting room 1.5 metres away from
an infected person across the table, but have the clock reset itself every
time I leaned my chair back?
</p>
<p>
Secondly, the recommended “social distance” is two metres (and some
scientists have indicated this is inadequate and should be at least
doubled), so even the lower figure is not met for the app.  That aside, the
figure is somewhat arbitrary too, and presumably can only be determined by
signal strength or maybe a “handshake” time between the two devices.
Whatever, it will likely not be so precise as to differentiate distances
around 1.5 metres.  BTW, I do appreciate that the 1.5 metre figure is not
necessarily precise, and anyway the signal distance will vary by situation
and over time.
</p>
<p>
Now some will argue—with fair reason—that the actual distance and time
are not <em>that</em> important; after all, whether or not a person (or cat) is
infected by another is highly variable and unpredictable.  However, it is
this variability and unpredictability that contributes to undermining the
usefulness/purpose of the app.  The imprecision in detection of “contacts”
is likely to generate many—very possibly too many—false positives and -
potentially worse and definitely ‘too’—many false negatives.  And the “too
many” false positives presents the potential for the mischievous and
malevolent to effectively ‘DDOS’ the system.  It's use will likely, as with
some other proposals, engender a false sense of security among users.
</p>

failed to catch Apple's erroneous autocorrection—MB.

&gt; The creation of a global surveillance juggernaut that governments will
&gt; never willingly give up or restrict solely to public health situations!
&gt; -LW
</p>
<p>
This is what worries me.  World War 2 ended in Europe in May 1945 (we were
due to have a big 75th anniversary commemoration next month), but British
governments of the day didn't really pay much attention.  We had identity
cards until 1950, rationing well into the 1950s, conscription until 1960,
and exchange controls until 1980—in the 1970s, Brits traveling abroad on
vacation were limited to taking 50 pounds (~$60) with them.
</p>
<p>
Since then, about 15 years ago the government was enthusiastically
proceeding with plans for compulsory national identity cards (“we'll find
them so useful that we we'll wonder how we ever managed without them!”)
backed up with a computerised citizens' database.  More recently, in last
year's British general election, if the Labour party had won there was a
strong possibility that exchange controls would have to be re-introduced to
prevent the loss of tax revenues.  Since the Covid-19 lockdown, various
politicians in the UK have proposed that this is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity to reorder society on a fairer, more-equitable basis, presumably
more like the popular and successful models of Cuba or the Soviet
Bloc… :o) There's a letter in today's newspaper saying “I hope this
pandemic cements the use of debit cards for all transactions and thereby the
end of cash”.
</p>
<p>
Whether you consider these developments as good or bad depends on your
politics, but I feel uneasy if they're introduced under the guise of
tackling a public health issue.  Benjamin Franklin's famous quote comes to
mind:
</p>
<p class="pre">&gt; “They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary
&gt; safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.”

I suggested this some time back, only I was thinking of a truly diminutive
fee: 1 mil (1/10 cent). For normal users, this would be down in the grass —
not even worth bothering with. I also suggested a mechanism whereby:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
The recipient can “accept“ the email, in which case there is no fee
</li>
<li>
Opt-in mailing lists: no fee. Otherwise the moderator of RISKS might end
up paying a significant fee, to say nothing of all the people who sign up
for notifications from Facebook etc.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Most spammers send out millions or tens of millions of messages, and don't
care that most of them don't lead anywhere—they make a profit if 1 person
falls for it (Nigerian scam) or for commercial ads if 1/100 of 1%
respond. This would either stop most of those spams, or force them to be a
great deal more selective in who they send their emails to.
</p>
<p>
I'd love to see the same for telephone calls: if the recipient rejects the
call, the caller is charged 10 cents, split between the phone system and the
recipient. Phone calls are a great deal more intrusive than emails, which is
why I suggest the higher fee.
</p>
<p>
At the time the idea was pooh-poohed (I no longer remember why). We'll see
what people think of Stewart Fist's version.

I know every reader of RISKS will initially bristle at the idea.  But, if we
were charged, say, 1 cent per mail sent, then most individuals would payonly
fractions of a dollar a day, and in a competitive world, this would beset
off against annual fees However those scam organisation which exist by
flooding the world's mailboxes with unwanted, illegal and disgusting emails
by the millions,would be quickly driven out of business.  The global email
and Internet system is never going to reach its potential until there is an
actual money penalty for abusing the technology.  Couldn't such a charge be
introduced on a global scale at the borders?

After reading the article, one thing I couldn't figure out was ‘which
Newton?’  There's a few throughout the country, and it could have been the
Newton near me, or hundreds of miles away, or one I've never heard of.
</p>
<p>
This is one constant issue with news sources, particularly local ones —
they often don't say where they are located.  Saying you're ‘XYZ area's
number one news source!’ might be good for the locals, but in today's
connected world, it doesn't help the guy who stumbles on a random news
article.  Also referring to your geographic location as being in the
‘bi/tri/quad-state region’.  To me, growing up on Long Island, ‘tri-state’
meant NY, NJ, CT.  To the local archery shop a bit west of me in
northeastern New Jersey, it means NJ, PA, and the southern tier of NY. Both
are technically correct correct, but neither really give me an idea of where
they are, and are ambiguous.
</p>
<p>
For the local paper's web site, the fix is easy—put the state you're in
at the top.  That resolves it, most of the time.  Until you hit New Jersey,
where we have plenty of localities with similar or identical names.
</p>
<p>
The risk?  Such ambiguities could incite or enrage people who read a story
and connect a name to a nearby location, when nothing at all has happened
there.  There's enough fake news going around.  We don't need to
unintentionally create more of it…
