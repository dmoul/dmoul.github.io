<div class="date">Sat, 21 Mar 2020 12:33:06 PDT</div>
<p>
Tom Krisher, SFChronicle.com (which as usual ignores the existence of the
  Science Fiction Chronicle), front page of the Chron's Business Report, 21
  Mar 2020, PGN-ed
</p>
<p>
As we have noted in many cases (including Deepwater Horizon <a href="/Risks/29/49">RISKS-29.49</a>,
the Boeing 737 Max, and many others), attempts to place blame are often
frustrated by reality:  blame may be widely distributed.
</p>
<p>
The cited article by Tom Krisher notes the National Transportation Safety
Board (NTSB) report released on 19 Mar 2020 on the Tesla crash on 1 March
2019 in Delray Beach, Florida.  The Tesla was under Autopilot driving at 69
mph when the Autopilot neither braked or otherwise attempted to avoid a
tractor-trailer that crossed in its path.
</p>
<p>
The report noted that all of the following factors were relevant:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The driver of the Tesla for not paying attention.  He had turned the
  Autopilot on just 12.3 seconds before impact.  Autosteer (which keeps the
  car centered in its lane) turned on 2.4 seconds later.</li>
<p>
</p>
<li>The driver (who was not injured) of the tractor-trailer, which sheared off
  the roof of the Tesla</li>
<p>
</p>
<li>Tesla, because it allowed the driver to avoid paying attention to the
  Autopilot, and to limit where it was safe to use the Autopilot, activating
  it in conditions for which it was not designed.  (However, Tesla told the
  NTSB investigators that “forward collision warning and automatic
  emergency braking systems on Model 3 in the Delray cash weren't designed
  to activate for crossing traffic or to prevent crashes at high speeds.”
  Tesla also had noted that the driver wasn't warned about not having his
  hands on the wheel “because the approximate 6-second duration was too
  short to trigger a warning under the circumstances.”  However, Tesla also
  claims that “the Autopilot is a driver-assist system, and that drivers
  must be ready to intervene at all times.”</li>
<p>
</p>
<li>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for its lax
  regulations, and failing to put limits on the use of automated driving
  systems to just those cases in which they were designed to work</li>
</ul>
<p>
A statement for the NTSB chairman Robert Sumwalt noted this was the “third
fatal vehicle crash we have investigated where a driver's overreliance on
Tesla's Autopilot and the operational design of the Tesla's Autopilot have
led to tragic consequences.”
</p>
<p>
Krisher notes that the Delray Beach crash was remarkably similar to one in
Williston FL in 2016, which also killed the driver of a Tesla.

The car is becoming a sentry, a chaperone, and a snitch.
</p>
<p>
My parked car got gashed in a hit-and-run two weeks ago. I found a star
witness: the car itself.
</p>
<p>
Like mine, your car might have cameras. At least one rearview camera has
been required on new American cars since 2018. I drive a Tesla Model 3 that
has eight lenses pointing in every direction, which it uses for backing up,
parking and cruise control. A year ago, Tesla updated its software to also
turn its cameras into a 360-degree video recorder. Even when the car is off.
</p>

</p>
<p>
All those digital eyes captured my culprit — a swerving city bus
— in remarkable detail. […]
</p>
<p>
Without Sentry Mode, I wouldn't have known what hit me.  The city's response
to my hit-and-run report was that it didn't even need my video
file. Officials had evidence of their own: That bus had cameras running,
too.

<p>
When trust erosion and brand outrage clobbers a for-profit brand, either the
marketplace settles the situation through corporate bankruptcy, or a remedy
— a second chance, a mulligan—is applied to repair and restore business
operations viability (aka profitability). NASA must reconcile a supplier
dilemma with corporate ramifications that will significantly impact US space
flight and strategic aerospace capabilities.
</p>
<p>
Boeing's software factory concealed issues that compromised the Starliner
mission. NASA apparently did not detect pre-release system/software
under-achievements or qualification shortcuts introduced to achieve
scheduled milestones. Rigorous release qualification practices and subject
matter expertise for the systems under test are mandatory prerequisites that
both supplier and customer must possess.  Unless expertise is mutually
shared, one party may be unfairly exploited for profit or convenience.
</p>
<p>
Not certain what the Boeing/NASA RACI required (roles/responsibilities in
terms of product engineering, test/measurement and review/sign-off), but
someone should have pulled the 'showstopper' cord well before liftoff. That
much is obvious from the Starliner mission record.
</p>
<p>
A key enabler to promote product life cycle defect escape suppression is
esprit de corps. Within Boeing, this intangible appears to have been
weakened. An organization needs participants that embody the “worst customer
in the world, best friend a product can find” inside the walls of their
factory to represent uncompromised customer interests.
</p>
<p>
Test engineers, especially, must embody this demeanor, and ethically abide
to “do no harm” principles by reporting and escalating mission/life critical
product deficiencies. These 'rara avises' enjoy breaking product. Finding
and reporting what's broken, before release, fulfills a software editorial
life cycle, a critical practice to achieve operational flight plan
viability. A defect tracking platform that is policed jointly with the
customer enables discussion and agreement on prioritized repairs. 'Release
defect patrol' promotes informed consent.
</p>
<p>
The product life cycle, especially in aerospace, requires all participants
(supplier/regulator/customer) to ethically and professionally practice
without fear of reprisal. 'Tin ear' management that fails to weigh project
triple constraints (cost, schedule, scope) with product safety and
mission/objectives must be held accountable for negligent practice.
</p>
<p>
Transparency and review are necessary to remediate and repair Boeing's

“Two years ago, the FAA warned in a safety alert that airlines and pilots
should ensure their procedures and check-lists address what to do about
odors and fumes on board and asked operators, manufacturers and regulators
to boost efforts at prevention. But the FAA hasn't ordered manufacturers to
actually change the way air on most planes gets funneled into the cabin,
which pilots say can be fouled by engine oil intermixing with breathable
air, due to the planes' design, combined with poor maintenance and faulty
seals.”

Why America Will Suffer Greatly Under Covid-19:<br>
the Broken Economics of Coronavirus<br>
A perfect storm of flawed institutions<br>
Black Cat<br>
12 Mar 2020  6 min read<br>
John Ohno is a co-author of this article.
</p>
<p>
A friend recently asked me: “what could be done better in America to stop
coronavirus?”  It was the kind of question that makes you pause for a good
long while before answering—because it suggests that the person asking
you has misunderstood you already. There is no single action that anyone
could or would take to slow this down, because these are systematic
problems.
</p>
<p>
This is going to be really bad. You should expect hospitals to get
overwhelmed, which will turn nonlethal cases into lethal ones. You should
expect international and national supply lines to be interrupted in some
cases.
</p>
<p>
You should stockpile about a month's worth of non-perishable foods and
medicine to treat the symptoms. Lentils, rice, vitamin supplements, Tylenol,
and Pedialyte—these are the cheapest ways to do this. You should not be
planning to avoid the disease—you should be planning as though you are
going to get the disease. It may be a hungry and generally awful summer, but
if you do not have complicating conditions, you will survive.
</p>
<p>
Here is why we will suffer terribly under this disease, even compared to
other countries:
</p>
<ul>
<li>not enough paid sick days</li>
<li>no nationalized healthcare</li>
<li>insufficiently-coordinated response</li>
<li>perfect-storm of supply chains and debt</li>
</ul>
<p>
These are all political choices, not features of the virus. This virus will
be worse here because it has been set up to be worse.
</p>
<h4>
Not enough paid sick days
</h4>
<p>
America does not have enough paid sick days, especially not for food service
workers, and these people do not own their own homes or have other sources
of basic subsistence—and so they will work when they are sick, because
they have to. They cannot afford to be publicly-minded. They do not have
the luxury of being nice.
</p>
<p>
And because they will work when they are sick, they will infect you. They
will infect the food that you eat—stop eating out! Anywhere!—they will
infect your packages, and so on. Even if you are oh-so-cautious, other
people will not be. And they will be infected.  More than that, people will
work through their infections. And so more of these cases will become
acute. Which will mean more long-term organ damage and more deaths.
</p>
<h4>
No nationalized healthcare
</h4>
<p>
Sick people will not get treatment, and so they will infect more people than
they otherwise would have, and be more likely to die. Those that survive
will in many cases be saddled with medical debt, weighing down any future
economic recovery.
</p>
<p>
I really do not know what more to say about this. Even if you are wealthy
and/or hate poor people, a bunch of people who are sick and can't afford
treatment can get you sick—there are very clear reasons of self-interest
for having a health-care system that takes care of everyone.
</p>
<h4>
Insufficiently coordinated response
</h4>
<p>
The American health system isn't.
</p>
<p>
This is worse than just the CDC avoiding testing people, to keep the
official numbers low—though that is a great example of how bureaucratic
incentives can kill. Most of the know outbreaks in the US seem to simply be
places where local health authorities circumvented the CDC and did their own
tests—it seems likely that there are many more outbreaks and many more
cases in the US than it would appear on paper.
</p>
<p>
There are multiple federal-level bureaus and NGOs responsible for the
country-wide picture, and they are not set-up to coordinate properly. There
are 50 state-level bureaus, each of which will do different things, and none
of them are allowed to close state borders without congressional
approval. There are about 3000 county-level health boards, and they all have
different standards and different funding mechanisms. In addition, there are
city-level efforts, and efforts being taken by private institutions. None of
these are in any way coordinated.
</p>
<h4>
Perfect Storm of Supply Chains and Debt
</h4>
<p>
Automation hasn't made production
or distribution or service more resilient, because it's been put toward
further centralization—rather than requiring a large proportion of
blue-collar workers to stop work in order to stop production, a smaller
proportion of a smaller number of white-collar workers control the machinery
by which work is distributed to the blue-collar workers. That machinery is
fragile enough that without monitoring it, it will become dysfunctional. It
is possible that the flow of consumer goods into stores might be disrupted
temporarily, making it hard to obtain some goods needed for daily life.
</p>
<p>
The idea of a deadly disease that can spread not only through face-to-face
contact but through the semi-automated alternatives we have redirected most
of our commerce towards (mail order with packages sorted by people who
certainly won't be taking sick days, &amp; takeout delivered by the same) is
uniquely suited to screwing up an economy in which both visible and hidden
labor is largely performed by a growing precariat [?] whose contract with
capital is based on the presumption of a happy path in which no catastrophes
are permitted.
</p>
<p>
Since the great recession, many firms have reoriented to operate at much
higher ratios of debt to income. This, plus the just-in-time supply chains
that have become common in the last few decades, makes these firms extremely
fragile—they have no buffer. Thus, a big disruption to a bunch of firms
at once can make many of them be unable to service their debts or even go
out of business, which disrupts supply chains further, which can cause more
of these companies to become insolvent. This is all much more of a problem
for smaller firms than it is for larger, richer, firms with more resources
and more confidence from lenders: the eventual recovery will be one in which
the big firms have had their smaller competitors eliminated.
</p>
<p>
Essentially all the infrastructure has been built on the assumption that
none of the other infrastructures would break down. Which has ironies,
because it shows that the economy bares more isomorphs to the Stalinist one
than anyone is really comfortable admitting—everything is fine until
circumstances change, and then people start dying, because neither allows
much room for bottom-up flows of information or distributed responses.
There's this assumption that the mass of blue-collar service workers will
always be sufficiently available (at less-than-minimum-wage prices) to do
whatever needs to be done, and a pandemic that hits the only people doing
the traveling and touching the packages is going to really screw that up.
So very much of our densely populated and highly interconnected world is
based around the supposed invincibility of modern medicine: the vaccine,
antibiotics, and so on. When that fails, so much else does, too.  In a
sense, there is a preview of a general strike, with this coronavirus.
Evictions, rents, and mortgage payments have all been frozen in certain
places. During the peak of this, people will either avoid going to work out
of fear, or be sick enough to stay home. There are certain obvious
similarities, and someone more schooled in the theory of this tactic might
be able to point out how to exploit the coronavirus collapse.

Zoom is a work-from-home privacy disaster waiting to happen
</p>
<p>
Just because you're working from home doesn't mean your boss isn't still
keeping tabs on your every mouse click.  In recent days, thanks in part to
the social-distancing measures made necessary by the coronavirus outbreak,
converts to the work-from-home life are being forced to contend with the
widely used videoconferencing service Zoom. There's just one problem: It's
not exactly privacy-friendly.
</p>
<p>
Long the bane of remote workers, Zoom is equipped with numerous settings
that even many of its longtime users may not know about. Take, for example,
the “attendee attention tracking” feature. According to Zoom, if enabled,
this feature allows hosts of conference calls—i.e., your boss—to
monitor participants' computers.

</p>
<p>
I run Zoom on iPad while multi-tasking on computer, phone, whatever. I have
camera disabled from app AND have mechanical cover over it, and I mute
myself to not broadcast keyboard noise. I love Zoom—much prefer it to
other conferencing tools I've used—and, of course, my conferences are
related to volunteering so there's no “boss” involved.

Advanced camera systems are raising fears of data collection, false alarms
and newborn privacy: “We have the technology to do this kind of constant
surveillance and hyper-monitoring, [but] it's driving parents insane.”
</p>
<p>
Baby-monitor companies are pushing artificial-intelligence technology into
the family nursery, promising that surveillance software designed to record
infants' faces, sounds and movements can save them from injury or death.
</p>
<p>
But medical, parenting and privacy experts say the safety claims made for
such Internet-connected systems aren't supported by science and merely prey
on the fears of young parents to sell dubious technology. No federal agency
has provided evidence to back them up.

A new browser privacy study by Professor Doug Leith, the Computer Science
department chair at Trinity College is worth reading carefully.  Leith
instruments the Mac versions of six popular browsers (Chrome, Firefox,
Safari, Edge, Yandex and Brave) to see what happens when they <i>phone home</i>.
All six make non-obvious connections to various backend servers, with Brave
connecting the least and Edge and Yandex (a Russian language browser) the
most. How they connect and what information they transmit is worth
understanding, particularly if you are paranoid about your privacy and want
to know the details.

TikTok is one of the fastest growing social content sharing apps in the

tied to their age, location and other details, raising alarm among
cybersecurity researchers that users could have been unmasked or
blackmailed.  The data exposure, discovered by independent researchers and
shown to <i>The Washington Post</i>, allowed anyone to access all of the location
data and other information tied to anonymous <i>whispers</i> posted to the
popular social app, which has claimed hundreds of millions of users. The
records were viewable on a non-password-protected database open to the

The paper record goes into a ballot box, so they can count the paper ballots
to check the software count.  You can't let people take home a record of how
they voted, since that enables vote buying.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p>
Other than the buzzword factor, I'm trying to figure out what advantage this
very complex scheme has over an off the shelf system where voters hand mark
paper ballots and drop them in a ballot box.  You can get computerized
ballot boxes that count the ballots as they're dropped in the box if for
some reason you believe it would be a problem to wait for the result while
people hand-count them.  That's what we use here in N.Y.

idea to do all absentee voting as Oregon does.

It's most likely that the ‘smarter' watch types that track the year, insert
29 Feb on years divisible by 4 (which in the simplest form, requires just
looking at the lower 2 bits of the year number).  These are going to fail on

Last Saturday night (for most practical purposes) I checked my digital watch
(which listens to WWVB for accurate time/date information) at what was still
eight minutes after midnight at my house. The watch had, at midnight,
checked in and apparently got a good signal. But it had already “leaped”
forward, so it said 1:08 and had the date (which was correct) as 8 Mar. But
of course the time was not legally supposed to go forward until 2:00 AM by
my local time (CST, becoming CDT).
</p>
<p>
I am wondering if that is a defect in the watch's firmware, or did WWVB send
out an incorrect time signal? I have trusted WWV, with or without the B, for
almost seven decades now, and I think I would rather blame the watch
manufacturer than NIST. (Which I will probably be still calling NBS for as
long as I am listening!)
