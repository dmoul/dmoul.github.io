<pre>
An article in the Boston Globe on January 2, 1989 describes the use of 
digital technology to retouch or drastically alter photographs, with results 
that show no evidence of the fact that alterations were done. The article 
said: "The 80's are fast becoming the last decade in which photos can be 
considered evidence of anything." It pointed out that the only confidence we 
can have in these digital photographs relies upon the ethics of the people 
who use the machines. In response to the question: "What about the ethics of 
all this?" a vendor of the technology is quoted as answering: "That's up to 
you." George Wedding of the Sacramento Bee is quoted as saying: "I hope that 
10 years from now readers will be able to pick up a newspaper and magazine 
and believe what they read and see. Whether we are embarking on a course 
which will make that impossible, I don't know. I'm afraid we have."

This is not the first time I've read about this technology, and every article 
I've read has raised the concern that the new technology renders inoperative 
a very basic assumption made by society (and the law, in particular) since 
the development of photographic technology; namely, that a photograph can be 
considered to be reliable evidence. Until recently, it was virtually 
impossible to alter a photograph without leaving evidence of the alteration; 
physical evidence was available to confirm or deny the authenticity of the 
photo. With digital photos, this is no longer true.

The article reminded me, however, of a more basic concern I have regarding 
the use of computer technology. Computer technology has had the following 
impacts upon record-keeping:

1) The use of electronic storage to eliminate physical storage (e.g., 
paper) of information has certain clear benefits, but has also 
eliminated reliable records of that information, because electronic 
storage media can be altered without leaving any evidence of alteration. 
Electronic records cannot be considered to be as reliable as physical 
records (certainly not today, and perhaps not ever). The best we can do 
is provide a combination of physical security and software controls to 
attempt to assure the reliability of records; and as we all know, 
software controls are not all that reliable and in any case can be 
circumvented, often with the greatest of ease.

2) Computer technology renders the task of altering electronic records 
extremely easy. Forgery has been a problem ever since written records 
were first used. But before computer technology was used to store and 
manipulate records, few people were capable of forging records well 
enough to fool anyone else — forgery of physical records requires a 
considerable skill, possessed by relatively few people. Successful 
alteration and forgery of electronic records, however, requires 
considerably less skill — and the skill it does require is usually one 
that a large number of people possess: the ability to use a computer.

3) Computer technology has made it practical to store and manipulate far 
larger volumes of information than could be handled with prior 
technology. We have no practical means of verifying the integrity of 
such large volumes of information, and are thus left with no choice but 
to trust that the electronic records are accurate. It is wholly 
impractical, for example, for the Social Security Administration's 
entire data base (how many hundreds of millions of individual records?) 
to be manually audited to verify its accuracy.

What bothers me is the combination of factors: the electronic storage of the 
information makes it very easy to carry out successful alterations and 
forgeries, and the volume of information makes it practically impossible to 
verify the authenticity of the information. As we put more kinds of 
information under the control of computer technology, it seems to me that we 
make it ever more difficult to trust the authenticity of information. 
Computer technology has the potential (and is in fact beginning to realize 
that potential) to destroy the very important and fundamental concept that 
truth is ascertainable from physical evidence.

Are we approaching the point (or have we reached it already?) where truth is, 
for all practical purposes, whatever the computer says it is? Where what is 
accepted as truth is easily manipulated by those who are privileged to have 
access to the digital keepers of truth?

We observe a bit of this phenomenon in advertising (commercial and 
political), where public perception of truth is subtly manipulated by images 
and propaganda; and to that extent, this is not a phenomenon peculiar to 
computer technology. But most of us are at least aware that advertising is on 
the face of it an attempt to persuade us to believe a certain thing, and thus 
that its appearance of "truth" is not to be taken at face value. We at the 
same time continue to believe that facts are facts, and that there are 
reliable ways to permanently record objective truth.

The computer is depriving us of the ability to authenticate that which is 
purportedly a recording of objective truth. What will the impact be upon 
society when we come to understand that we can no longer trust those forms of 
evidence that we have so long taken for granted to be reliable? When an 
authentic-looking photograph shows something that may or may not have 
actually existed? When an apparently authentic sound recording reproduces 
sounds that may or may not have actually occurred? When a corporation's 
audited and verified financial records describe financial activities that may 
or may not have ever occurred?

Not that these are really new threats: individuals have for a long time 
attempted to falsify all kinds of records. But in times past, it has been so 
difficult to succeed at forgery that we have been confident that a forgery 
could be detected. That confidence leads to the confidence that if a physical 
record passes all authenticity tests, it is indeed a reliable record.

Computer technology has destroyed this confidence. Where are the authenticity 
tests for electronic records? Is it ever possible for us to have the same 
high degree of confidence in electronic records that we have in physical 
records? I understand software too well to suppose that today's software 
technology is capable of supporting really trustworthy verification of the 
authenticity of electronic records, and I'm not convinced that software can 
ever be trustworthy enough to achieve the level of reliability possessed by 
physical records. But does that mean that we shouldn't use computer 
technology to manage information? How do we in the computer industry deal 
with this problem?

               A Digital Matter of Life and Death
                        by Ivars Peterson
                   Science News, 12 March 1988

The radiation-therapy machine, a Therac 25 linear accelerator, was designed to
send a penetrating X-ray or electron beam deep into a cancer patient's body to
destroy embedded tumors without injuring skin tissue.  But in three separate
instances in 1985 and 1986, the machine failed.  Instead of delivering a safe
level of radiation, the Therac 25 administered a dose that was more than 100
times larger then the typical treatment dose.  Two patients died and a third
was severely burned.
     The malfunction was caused by an error in the computer program controlling
the machine.  It was a subtle error that no one had picked up during the
extensive testing the machine had undergone.  The error surfaced only when a
technician happened to use a specific, unusual combination of keystrokes to
instruct the machine.
     The Therac incidents and other cases of medical device failures caused by
computer errors have focused attention on the increasingly important role
played by computers in medical applications.  Computers or machines with
built-in microprocessors perform functions that range from keeping track of
patients to diagnosing ailments and providing treatments.
     "The impact of computers on medical care and the medical community is the
most significant factor that we have to face," says Frank E.  Samuel Jr.,
president of the Health Industry Manufacturers Association (HIMA), based in
Washington, D.C.  "Health care will change more dramatically in the next 10
years because of software-driven products than for any other single cause."
Samuel made his remarks as a recent HIMA-sponsored conference on the regulation
of medical software.
     At the same time, reports of medical devices with computer-related
problems are appearing more and more frequently.  In 1985, the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) reported that recalls of medical devices because of
computer faults had roughly doubled over the previous five years.  Since then,
the number of such complaints has risen further.
     The problems range across a wide spectrum of computer-based medical
devices.  A system designed for monitoring several patients at once was
recalled because it kept mixing up the patients.  A programmable heart
pacemaker suddenly "froze" while it was being adjusted by a doctor.  A device
for dispensing insulin delivered the drug at an inappropriate rate.  An expert
system gave the wrong diagnosis, resulting in a patient receiving a drug
overdose.  An ultrasound scanner sometimes underestimated fetal weight.
     "No one can deny that allowing computers to perform some of the functions
normally carried out by trained and licensed medical professionals raises
questions concerning the personal health and safety of citizens," Michael
Gemignani of the University of Maine in Orono comments in ABACUS (Vol. 5, No.
1).  "But even if we agree something more needs to be done to protect society
in the face of these technological innovations, we are still left with the
question: What should be done and by whom?"
     The FDA, in its mandated role as guardian of public health and safety, is
now preparing to regulate the software component of medical devices.  The
agency's effort has already raised questions about what kinds of products,
software and information systems should be regulated.
     Last fall, the FDA published a draft policy for the regulation of computer
products marked for medical use.  In that policy, the concept of "competent
human intervention" sets the dividing line between what is and is not
regulated.  In other words, the computer product in question is subject to
regulation if a qualified doctor or nurse cannot effectively intervene to
override the machine's actions.  Devices such as software-driven cancer therapy
machines, programmable heart pacemakers and automatic drug dispensers clearly
fall into that category.
     On the other hand, the FDA states that it would not regulate computer
products that simply store, retrieve and disseminate information analogous to
that traditionally provided by textbooks and journals.  In addition, the
agency's regulations would not apply to computer products used only for
communications, general accounting or teaching.
     For example, a physician may use a computer program known as an expert
system to help make a diagnosis.  Because the expert system does not directly
drive another medical device that, say, could dispense a drug when needed, and
because the doctor can make an independent judgment, such an expert system
would be exempt from FDA rules governing medical devices.
     However, the greatest advantage of software - its flexibility - is also,
from a regulatory point of view, one of its biggest problems.  Computer
programs are easy to change and can be used in many different ways.  If
corrections are made or new features added, how much scrutiny should the
modified version of a previously approved computer product undergo?  That
question is still unresolved.
     Furthermore, it's sometimes hard to make a clear distinction between
programs that perform a "library" function and those that can be classified as
being part of a medical device.  A case in point is the patient medical record,
traditionally a file folder containing various sheets of paper listing
treatments, medical observations and other pieces of information vital for the
patient's proper care.
     Many hospitals are now moving toward medical records that are stored on a
computer.  The difficulty arises when such information systems are connected
directly to machines that, for example, record patient blood pressure and heart
rate.  If a nurse takes down the data and then enters the figures into a
computer, the information system software would not be subject to FDA rules.
But if the machine sends the data directly to the computer, then the
information system is considered by the FDA to be an "accessory" to a medical
device and subject the same level of regulation as the machine itself.
     Information system vendors disagree with the FDA's position.  They argue
that the FDA does not presently have rules governing the quality and content of
paper medical records.  There's no reason for the FDA to start regulating such
records, they say, just because the records happen to be in a computer's memory
rather than on paper.  In fact, using a computer-based system would
dramatically reduce the incidence of errors in patient records, the vendors
claim.  The benefits of improved record keeping would clearly outweigh the need
for burdensome regulation.
     The FDA's James S. Benson concedes that "regulation is not the automatic
solution to problems in hospitals and elsewhere."  Nevertheless, the agency
must comply with a 1976 law that contains a broad definition of what
constitutes a medical device.  Interpreted in its broadest sense, the
definition encompasses practically everything used in a hospital, from X-ray
machines to pencils.
     FDA officials say they recognize the difficulties involved in regulating
medical software.  "The agency fully appreciates the revolution occurring in
medicine with the introduction of computers and microprocessors," says Frank E.
Young, FDA commissioner.  "We're taking a reasoned, structured approach with a
minimum of oversight.  We have tried to give general guidelines.  The policy
has been deliberately made flexible."
     The flexibility allows the FDA to consider applications for approval on a
case-by-case basis.  That limits the "chilling fear of undue regulation," says
Young.  Furthermore, as technologies change and experience with computers in
medical applications grows, decisions on how much regulation is needed may also
change.
     To many manufacturers and users of medical products, the FDA's idea of
flexibility leaves too much uncertainty and opens up the possibility of
increased regulation in the future.  "The FDA casts too wide a net," says
Edward M. Basile of King &amp; Spalding, a law firm in Washington, D.C.  "Their
basic assumption is that everything should be regulated."
     "There's no disagreement about the extremes," says Harold M. Schoolman of
the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Md.  "The question is how and
where to draw the line between the extremes."  The important issue, he says, is
maintaining a balance between appropriate safeguards and incentives for
innovation.
     Even in situations where it's clear that certain software ought to be
reviewed, the FDA faces the additional difficulty of how to go about verifying
that a particular computer program does what it's supposed to do — nothing
more, nothing less.  As experience with software for other applications has
shown, the task of checking software quality can be overwhelming (SN: 9/13/86,
p. 171).
     A few years ago, when most medical devices did not contain computers, it
was relatively easy to foresee all possible inputs and to check the
consequences of each one, says James Howard of General Electric's Medical
Systems Group in Milwaukee, Wis.  With computers, the number of possible paths
is greatly increased.  "It's more important than ever to build safe products
that perform as required," he says.  But because a detailed analysis takes so
long, it often can't be done.  "This is a major concern to both manufacturers
and the FDA," says Howard.
     The FDA defines software as a "set of instructions that enables a
computing machine to control, monitor or otherwise interact with a medical
device." The proposed regulations require a software developer to show that the
algorithm, or mathematical recipe, used in the computer program is appropriate
and has been implemented correctly in the software.  The FDA also requires
assurance that any software failure would not injure the patient.
     How that assurance can be provided is still unclear.  Techniques for
evaluating software safety are relatively new.  Who does the checking, how much
evidence is enough and whether the FDA can perform an independent check are
also unresolved issues.  Furthermore, software developers are wary of
submitting complete listings of the instructions in their computer programs
because competitors may get a look at this "source code" by making a request to
the FDA under the Freedom of Information Act.
     The trouble with the FDA approach, says Howard, is that it doesn't
consider under what conditions software is used.  Instead, the FDA ought to
focus on the idea that not all computer errors are equally serious.  Using a
kind of hazard analysis to focus on situations that could lead to
life-threating computer failures would be one way to eliminate the most serious
potential faults and to shorten testing times.
     Software developers also need to improve the methods they use for
constructing computer programs.  We need to "industrialize" software
development so that programs are written in a consistent way, says James
Dobbins of Verilog USA, Inc., in Alexandria, Va.  Too often, programmers
include a description of what each part of a program does only as an
afterthought.  They rarely go back to clean up or polish a program to make it
more understandable.
     Software development can be standardized and automated, says Dobbins.
"The tools are there to industrialize the whole process.  You just have to go
find them."
     Programmers, on the other hand, complain that they're in a no-win
situation.  Software is continually modified as it evolves, often to meet
demands for new features to make the product more competitive.  In the rush to
market, when delays can put a company at a competitive disadvantage, software
testing often loses out.  Delays in completing a software package are balanced
against the possibility of failing to root out potentially embarrassing errors.
     This is the kind of situation that can lead to lawsuits, says Vincent
Brannigan, an attorney in Adelphi, Md.  Software is clearly a product, he says.
If it's defective and injures a consumer, then the manufacturer is liable.
     Among the faults Brannigan lists is the tendency of software and computer
companies to promise more than they can fulfill and to cut costs by doing less
testing.  This is the only field, he says, where the customer is expected to
pay for finishing a product through the purchase of periodic updates and
corrections to the software.
     "Disclaimers don't mean anything," Brannigan says.  "The product should
have been right in the first place." That means paying much more attention to
how software is written and tested.  "The software must look as shiny and clean
as the rest of the machine," he says.
     So far, software developers have generally escaped damaging lawsuits and
settlements, but that may change.  To many medical-device producers, the threat
of litigation may be even more effective than proposed FDA regulations for
assuring the quality of products.
     Even finding out what went wrong is a time-consuming process.  The FDA and
other groups are still investigating aspects of why the Therac 25, manufactured
by Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd. in Kanata, Ontario, failed.  What's evident is
that the problem could probably have been avoided if an appropriate safety
analysis had been done.
     The Therac 25 delivers two forms of radiation:  either a high-energy
electron beam or, when a metal target intercepts the electron beam, a
lower-energy X-ray beam.  It turns out that when a nimble, experienced
technician punches in a particular sequence of commands faster than the
programmers had anticipated, the metal target fails to swing into place.
     A safety analysis would have identified the missing target as a
potentially dangerous situation.  The machine could have been programmed so
that it couldn't operate if the target, as confirmed by a sensor, were not in
place.
     Perhaps such a complex, computer-driven machine wasn't even necessary.  By
sacrificing a little convenience and flexibility, a machine with a simple
on-off switch and a timer could probably have done the same job - with a much
smaller chance of failure.

    [This is a familiar topic to RISKS readers, but this particular article
    is extremely well written and seems worth including, even if old.
