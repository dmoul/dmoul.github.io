Summarized from an article by Roxana Kopetman, Los Angeles Times, 10 Jan 1991:

Long Beach, California, police officials believe that a programming error
partly explains why their department has the worst crime solving record among
11 large California cities.

The California Department of Justice ranks departments by their rate of solving
crimes.  Long Beach has placed last 11 times in the last 15 years.  Last year,
for example, the city solved 14.2% of its cases; the statewide average is 22%.

However, the department just found out that their system lists a crime as
solved only if it is solved in the same month it was reported.  Other police
departments don't do this.  The tallies are done by a program in the city's
information services bureau.

Police don't put all the blame on the program.  They cite an understaffed
detective bureau and officers taking time off for job-related injuries at a
rate three times the state average, taking twice as long as average to return
to work.

A friend related an experience he had calling a swimming pool supply company's
800 number to find a local distributor.  The operator asked for his zip code
and told him the address of the nearest distributor, saying it was 3.5 miles
away.  It actually was more like 8 miles, so my friend figured the distance
was measured from his post office.  Since he lives near a zip code boundary,
he asked for the nearest distributor from the neighboring zip code, hoping to
find something closer.  This is where things started to get weird, so he tried
zip codes from his office and parents' home:

  Start location &amp; Zip      Nearest distributor location &amp; distance
   Sherman Oaks, CA 91423     Reseda (3.5 reported miles, 8 actual miles)
   North Hollywood  91607     Hacienda Heights (30 miles! Reseda's closer!)
   Santa Monica     90405     Torrance (15 miles)
   West Los Angeles 90064     Carson City, Nevada (400 miles!)

At this point my friend figured out what was happening:

   Sherman Oaks     91423  ==&gt;  91335  Reseda
   North Hollywood  91607  ==&gt;   917xx  Hacienda Heights
   Santa Monica     90405  ==&gt;   905xx  Torrance
   West Los Angeles 90064  ==&gt;   897xx  Carson City, Nevada

The programmer obviously assumed that proximity in zip codes meant proximity in
space.  E.g., for 90064, since there was no distributor in 900xx, the program
tried 901xx and 899xx, then 902xx and 898xx, etc.   How many customers wasted
their time and gas going to the wrong store?  How much business did the company
lose from people who decided not to make a long trip?

I've noticed similar foolishness from companies that assume that any store
location in my telephone area code (818) is worth telling me about, while none
of the nearer stores in neighboring 213 are.

The following falls into the "Isn't this a small world" category.  It appears
that the Soviet Union is getting more Westernized by the moment.  Their
criminals and police seem to be just like ours.

The message originally appeared on internet news and then was posted on a net
concerned with Soviet computing (USSRECOM).

&gt; An article in `The Irish Times' Jan 3 states that extremely sensitive
&gt; information relating to British military operations in the Gulf may
&gt; still be on a computer which was stolen from a staff car ...

It is worth adding that this information was known and published outside
of the UK, but was not published (censorship) in the UK until (I think)
6 Jan 91 when Associated Press threatened to run the story anyway.

Here's a quick rundown on RISKS of stepping through the doors on a New York
City subway car: each of the twin doors can be as much as 3 inches open
when the train starts moving, giving you a maximum gap of 6".  Although an
interlock prevents the train from starting while the doors are open (called
the "indication" by the train crew), the sensors aren't too precise.  People
can (and do) get dragged by moving cars when they're stuck in the doors.
Usually it's their own fault — hyped up New Yorkers who won't wait the next
three or five minutes for the next rush hour train (or ten or twenty minutes
off peak) blocking the doors open in the vain hope the conductor will
re-open and let them in.  As a previous RISK poster noted, this all depends
on the conductor's mood and if s/he is in a hurry or not.  It also depends on
their line supervisors: some managers emphasize speed, others passenger safety.

A few years ago the Transit Authority had a problem with "doors opening
enroute" on the older (pre-1976 or so) cars — an individual door would
open while the train was in motion, once on a speeding express train
(thankfully, no one was hurt).  The TA rewired all their newer trains
with an interlock so that the emergency brake would activate if the
doors opened while the train was in motion.

You can experiment with this safety interlock by attempting to force one of the
doors open while the train is moving.  One day I observed two teenagers on the
way to Brooklyn doing exactly that, thrilling over pushing open a door two
inches as the train sped through the tunnel.  When I warned them that they
would kick in the emergency brake if they went too far they had a spell of
enlightened self-interest (it can take ten or fifteen minutes for the crew to
reset the emergency brake) and left the poor door alone.

I was interested in Olivier M.J. Crepin-Leblond's two mailings (<a href="/Risks/10/75">RISKS-10.75</a>)
regarding the recent train crash and the behaviour of tube train doors.

I am also a victim (sorry, commuter! :-) of "Network South-East", the bit of
what used to be British Rail that serves East Anglia and the area south-east
of London. They are a by-word for discomfort and overcrowding, even where the
rolling stock is new, as it is on the lines from Peterborough and Cambridge
into London King's Cross. It was recognised at the enquiry into the Clapham
rail disaster that a large proportion of the deaths and serious injuries in
a crash can be attributed to passengers having to stand in the aisles between
the seats. Even a low-speed impact means that standing passengers who insist
on obeying Newton's first law of motion will continue their journey along the
carriage until brought to rest by their fellow passengers or by the door to
the adjoining carriage.

Even so, it does not appear to be cost-effective to supply adequate numbers
of carriages to cope with the rush-hour. After all, the management has to
show a profit so that privatisation will attract investors, and a yearly
season ticket between Stevenage and London only costs 1744 pounds sterling.

Another bit of cost-cutting is to use driver-only trains. There is no guard
to check the doors before the train pulls out. This is so on most rail and
underground services. There is usually a TV monitor which the driver can use
to check the length of the platform. This does not seem to be particularly
effective, judging by the number of incidents I have personally witnessed
over the last few years, such as:

A driver closing the automatic doors and pulling away after a mother got out
but before her children had time to leave the train. (Frantic waving and
shouting by other people on the platform made him stop.) - Network South-East.

An elderly woman boards the train (Underground: Piccadilly Line), and the
driver closes the doors and moves off before her equally elderly husband can
get on.

I leaped onto a crowded tube train (Underground: Metropolitan Line) carrying a
shoulder bag just as the doors were closing. I got on, but my bag didn't. The
doors closed around the strap, and the train moved away with the bag hanging
outside the carriage, and me pinned to the door by the strap around my shoulder,
just waiting for the first obstruction to snag the bag. Fortunately, someone
pulled the emergency handle, and the train stopped before it entered the tunnel.

What has this got to do with computers? Not a lot! All these incidents occurred
with a human in the loop (just one human, and obviously not very firmly in the
loop!). I think that less, not more, automation is the answer to safety here.
Bring back the guard!

(I went through King's Cross on the Circle Line while the fire was raging a
few years ago. They're gonna get me one day! :-)

In the latest RISKS DIGEST:

Date: Wed, 9 Jan 91 13:09 BST
From: "Olivier M.J. Crepin-Leblond" &lt;MEEM37@vaxa.cc.imperial.ac.uk&gt;
Subject: Another train crash in London

&gt; [general criticism of British Rail esp. Network SouthEast]

Yes, there's been a major train crash in London. But I've seen no claims that
computers were involved - as Olivier points out, BR's main problem is hardware
dating from the 1950's, and hardly the over-enthusiastic application of new
technology. The UK news reports I heard only listed 1 fatality, and I wouldn't
like to estimate the number of deaths that would be likely to result from all
of the rail commuters driving into London instead. For seven years I travelled
about 20 miles a day (going to and from school) by Network SouthEast, and
although we didn't always get seats, clean trains, or particularly punctual
arrivals, we always got there in one piece. I don't think there exists a
perfect public transport system; the UK rail network only offers one of the
better alternatives.

Unlikely though this may seem to some of your readers, I am in no way connected
to British Rail, Network SouthEast, or any of their subsidiaries.

Thanks to budget cuts a fire company was recently closed near Richmond Hill,
in Queens (New York City).  This past Monday, two people died in a fire
nine blocks from the closed engine company.  It's been getting lots of local
news coverage, because the firefighter's union, in a bid to reverse the
closures, has claimed that those persons might have lived if the engine
company had not been shut down.

In the post-mortem analysis of the response to the fire, several other
problems were turned up that cost time in getting water pumped into the
burning building.  The biggest one was that the engine company that was
dispatched (engine companies have the pumps and hoses that will squirt water
from a hydrant into the fire, ladder companies have the rescue team for
clambering into the building and recovering people stuck inside) was told
that they were the "auxiliary" engine company.  So they did what an auxilliary
company is supposed to do, namely hook up to the second-closest hydrant and
let the "main" company get the first assault into the fire.  But the "main"
company was supposed to be the engine that had been closed down, and so no
other water-pumping equipment was sent.  The firefighters quickly realized
the mistake, and lost only a couple of minutes putting back their hoses and
moving to the closer hydrant.

Apparently the Fire Department's computer dispatch system was not updated
about the demise of the engine company, and thus designated the remaining
engine in the area as the auxiliary.  And despite news headlines about
firehouse closings, none of the dispatchers realized in time that they were
making an error.

It looks like the people who build dispatch systems (or telephone
operator's consoles, airline reservation systems, etc) are interesting only
in improving "efficiency", which usually translates to less operators and
lesser-trained operators.  In a place like NYC, without computer assistance
dispatchers would have to be well versed in the operations of the emergency
service they were controlling, if not the local neighborhood their units
were operating in.  Now, from what I've heard over my scanner, dispatchers
can be almost anyone who can sit in front of the computer console that's
supposedly keeping track of which units are where and which calls from 911
haven't been answered yet.  Operators can be changed or transferred frequently
because the computer is supposed to "remember" the status of all outstanding
calls.  So more work is dumped on lesser-trained people, and the results
are degraded service and mistakes like that described above.  (To be fair,
this is less true of the NYC Fire Department than of the Police Department.)

ABOUT COMPUTERS, FREEDOM &amp; PRIVACY

We are at a crossroads as individuals, organizations and governments depend
more and more on computers and computer networks.  Within ten years, most
global information will be collected and utilized electronically.

The 1990's are the pivotal decade in which statutes, policies and judicial
precedents will be developed for controlling access, use — and abuse — of
computerized information and electronic mail.

Current government and private-sector policies are an uncoordinated jumble,
created as  each group evolves ways  to collect, manipulate, extract,
share and protect computerized and networked information and services.

Data on individuals and groups is being computerized by numerous agencies,
organizations and special interests, often without the knowledge or approval
of those it concerns, and with varying degrees of accuracy.

Computers can greatly assist individuals, organizations and government in
making sound decisions based on efficient access to adequate information --
for personal benefit, business improvement and national well-being.

Or, inappropriate use and regulation can seriously threaten fundamental
freedoms, personal privacy, and the democratic processes that are at the
very foundation of this nation and of any free society.

ABOUT THE CONFERENCE SESSIONS (Tuesday-Thursday, March 26th-28th)

PLENARY SPEAKERS:

ABOUT THIS PREMIER EVENT

This is an intensive, multi-disciplinary survey Conference for those concerned
with computing, teleconferencing, electronic mail, computerized personal
information, direct marketing information, government data, etc. — and those
concerned with computer-related legislation, regulation, computer security, law
enforcement and national and international policies that impact civil
liberties, responsible exercise of freedom and equitable protection of privacy
in this global Information Age.

For the first time, this four-day invitational event will bring together
representatives from all of these groups and more, all in one place, all at one
time.

Many of the recognized leaders and strongest advocates representing the various
groups having an interest in the issues of the conference will discuss their
concerns and proposals.

A maximum of 600 applicants will be invited to attend.  Balanced representation
from the diverse groups interested in these issues is being encouraged.  Please
see the enclosed Invitation Application for details.

To inform participants about topics beyond their specialties, half-day seminars
are scheduled for the first day (Monday, March 25th).  These parallel tutorials
will explore relevant issues in computing, networking, civil liberties,
regulation, the law and law enforcement.  Each tutorial is designed for those
who are experienced in one area, but are less knowledgeable in the subject of
that tutorial.

To explore the interactions and ramifications of the issues, conference talks
and panel discussions are scheduled for the remaining three days
(Tuesday-Thursday, March 26th-28th).  These will emphasize balanced
representation of all major views, especially including probing questions and
discussion.

Explicit Conference events to foster communication across disciplines are
planned.  Working luncheons, major breaks and two evening banquets will further
encourage individual and small-group discussions.

Speakers include (among others) Ken Allen, Sharon Beckman, Jerry Berman, Paul
Bernstein, Sally Bowman, David Burnham, Mary Culnan, Peter Denning, Dorothy
Denning, Dave Farber (UPenn), Cliff Figallo, David Flaherty, John Ford, Bob
Gellman, Janlori Goldman, Harry Hammit, Martin Hellman, Evan Hendricks, Lance
Hoffman, Don Ingraham, Bob Jacobson, Mitch Kapor, Tom Mandel, John McMullen,
Peter Neumann, Donn Parker, Ron Plesser, John Quarterman, Jack Rickard, Tom
Riley, Lance Rose, Marc Rotenberg, Noel Shipman, Harvey Silverglate, Gail
Thackeray, Robert Veeder, Willis Ware, Sheldon Zenner.
