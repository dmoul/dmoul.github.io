I'm sure there will be several submissions on this.  The associated press
story on it contains the following "... Avid Modjtabai, head of technology
for the nation's fifth largest bank, said today that problems with the
company's online banking services lasted less than two hours, and customers
never lost the ability to make basic ATM transactions, including withdrawing
cash and making deposits at Wells Fargo-branded ATMs."  While I haven't been
able to verify that is the reason, on Sunday I had my Wells Fargo credit
("check") card refused by a merchant's POS terminal with the code "card
blocked."  My account has plenty of money in it and there are no untoward
transactions in it.  (That I was able to check.  Go figure).  I tried
calling calling WF off and on all day yesterday to see if they knew why the
card was blocked and they couldn't find out — because their computers were
down.  Today I can't get through, presumably because of heavy call volume.

The Windows Genuine Disadvantage servers all went down.

Result: All attempted OS installations were labeled as counterfeit.
THAT means you get 'limp home' mode for the box..

The recovery procedure, once you know their server is again working,
involves deleting some special files, and revisiting the WGA server.

{Sigh; haven't we had this conversation before?}

RISKS:

  Creating an artificial single-point-of-failure.

  Not making that single point robust/redundant enough to defend again all
  enemies, foreign and domestic [i.e. outsiders vs the more likely "we have
  met the enemy, and he is us..." errors.]

  Not having good recovery procedure when the Can't Happen Does
  Happen... [Can your mother find her data.dat file?]

I wonder if the server farm has both geographic and network diversity.
(There was a Jan 2001 failure of all Microsoft nameservice; then, they were
in one place, on one segment.)

I also worry about what happens if somehow, sometime, the MS database gets
trashed, and it decides ALL copies of XP/VISTA/Win2009/whatever are
pirated. So when every machine does its obligatory check-in, and gets
castrated...

  quaintly peaceful a place Tokyo is that allows them to treat this as news.]

Subway train passes station after line switched to wrong track

A subway train was forced to pass a station it was supposed to stop at on
Monday evening because the line was switched to a track exclusively for
trains passing the station, the subway operator said.

At about 6:40 p.m., the driver of a local train on the Tokyo Metro Tozai
Line slowed down his train to stop at Baraki-Nakayama Station in Funabashi,
Chiba Prefecture, but noticed the train had gone onto the passing track,
Tokyo Metro officials said.

The train was forced to continue on to the following Nishi-Funabashi
Station. About 840 passengers were aboard the train but the incident did not
cause major confusion.

Tokyo Metro officials pointed to the possibility that a computerized system
controlling the line's railway switches had developed trouble.  (Mainichi)

For two days beginning on 16 Aug 2007, Skype's peer-to-peer network was
critically unstable.  This evidently resulted after Skype users all around
the world rebooted their systems subsequent to getting a set of Microsoft
patches via Windows Update.  The flood of attempted Skype logins together
with a lack of adequate Skype network resources at that time prompted a
chain reaction.  Although this had never happened before, it revealed a flaw
in Skype's self-healing mechanism — which has now been fixed through
retuning of the algorithms.  This apparently had nothing to do with any
particular MS patches.  (Skype has something like 200 million users in
total, although only 5 or 6 million are generally online at once.  The peak
usage reported was 9 million in January 2007.)

  [Thanks to Lauren Weinstein for pointing out the Skype source with
  commentary by Villu Arak, 20 Aug 2007 and clarification on 21 Aug:
    <a href="http://heartbeat.skype.com">http://heartbeat.skype.com</a>,
  The site also includes current Skype status along with a note yesterday on
  a presumably temporary problem that involves payments using either of two
  banks in Estonia.  PGN-ed]

It is funny to see all the articles in Telecom magazines and blogs about how
Skype is unreliable as proven by last week's outage.  These people seem to
forget that the vaunted PSTN has had many such outages. I posted here in
RISKS back in 1993 about a Pacific Bell DACS software upgrade that went bad
and knocked out most of Orange County, California for a day. How often has
the PSTN been killed by radio contests and natural disasters? Any large
scale system can and will suffered from such problems as it is growing. This
is nothing new to most RISKS readers.

In the Welsh country borough known as Vale of Glamorgan, there have been
several instances of foreign truck drivers following routings given by
satellite navigation and apparently unable to understand signs reading
"Unsuitable for heavy goods vehicles - Anaddas i gerbydau nwyddau trwm".

They are now experimenting with a pictographic sign instead — showing a
truck with a red slash through it, and a satellite overhead.  To me this
sign looks if heavy trucks whose drivers don't use satnav are now welcome...

  <a href="http://lauren.vortex.com/archive/000279.html">http://lauren.vortex.com/archive/000279.html</a>

I frequently make the assertion that it's impossible to successfully censor
the Internet by trying to remove materials that have already been posted
publicly after they've attracted attention.  What's published is published,
what's done is done.  The genie won't just refuse to go back into the
bottle, he'll stick his tongue out at you as well — or worse.

You may recall the international brouhaha a couple of weeks ago over the
Navy pulling from YouTube all copies of an (originally relatively obscure --
now infamous) amateur music video posted by a user named "PUMPIT01" and
produced on the aircraft carrier Ronald Reagan (CVN76), as described in
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/2tuzdz">http://tinyurl.com/2tuzdz</a> and many other stories.

The video in question ("Women of CVN76") has been variously described as
being removed due to security violations (brief shots of utterly innocuous
reactor-related areas), "inappropriate use of safety equipment," and other
explanations.

The real reason for the Navy's "reaction" is clearly just plain old ordinary
embarrassment, especially since the ship's CO has a cameo role in the
amusing production.

But my point here isn't to post a video review, but rather to emphasize that
for all the noise about deleting the video, it of course remains easily
available with but a minimum amount of effort.

You may feel that the inability to effectively "recall" posted materials is
a blow for freedom, or to the contrary an information control disaster.  But
either way, it's a fact — a reality that we can't escape.  And perhaps the
sooner we come to terms with this truth, the less time we'll be wasting at
shadow boxing with useless Internet censorship attempts.  There are far
better ways that we can be spending our time.

Excuse me?  Oh, where's the video?  Like I said, finding a copy is actually
quite simple.

Example: For the sake of the argument, let's say that you did a Google
Search right now for the straightforward query of:

  cvn-76 women pumpit01 "click here"

No magic words.  No secret codes.  Just pretty obvious stuff from the news
stories about the video, plus a little common search sense.  And while any
given search results are often fairly ephemeral, and any particular copy of
material found at any given time may still be removed, well, the Internet is
a big place, and the Lords of Censorship remain essentially impotent, for
better or worse, indeed.

An explosion in calls from cellular phones has overwhelmed critical parts of
California's 911 system, resulting in hundreds of thousands of lost calls
and lengthy waits to reach dispatchers even as crimes or potentially deadly
emergencies unfold.  Wireless 911 calls statewide have jumped roughly
tenfold since 1990, to more than 8 million last year. Cell calls now make up
the majority of all 911 calls, and key emergency agencies are struggling to
adapt.

The problems are aggravated by call surges — such as when multiple
motorists call in about the same accident — staffing shortages at 911
dispatch centers, and technological hurdles. Cell calls are more easily
interrupted or lost and take longer to handle, officials say, reducing the
number of calls each dispatcher can field.

Lauren Weinstein's Blog Update:
Cable Industry Responds Regarding HD TiVo Incompatibilities
August 25, 2007
  <a href="http://lauren.vortex.com/archive/000275.html">http://lauren.vortex.com/archive/000275.html</a>

[...] a few days ago I reviewed the situation concerning incompatibilities
between the new High Definition TiVo ("TiVo HD") and the Switched Digital
Video (SDV) systems being rapidly deployed by cable systems.
  <a href="http://lauren.vortex.com/archive/000273.html">http://lauren.vortex.com/archive/000273.html</a>

That was last Wednesday.  The following day, that blog item appeared on
Slashdot <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">http://www.slashdot.org</a> and was as a result very widely referenced
and discussed.  So much for Thursday.

Now comes word that the next day (yesterday), the cable industry trade
association (NCTA - National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Association)
  <a href="http://ibc.broadcastnewsroom.com/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=175784">http://ibc.broadcastnewsroom.com/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=175784</a>
made a filing with the FCC offering to develop a workaround for the problem.

As might be expected, NCTA is continuing to push the "OpenCable Application
Platform" (OCAP) system that the Consumer Electronics Association has found
to be unacceptable.

However, NCTA reportedly says in their new FCC filing that they are now
willing to develop a "tuning resolver" to work around the problem for
existing devices like the new TiVo.  This device would be a USB "dongle" to
handle SDV tuning (the second of the probable options that I mentioned in my
original blog item, as it happens).

While this is obviously a welcome development, two obvious questions are
"When?" and "How much will it cost?"

Obviously cost is important.  And if the device takes too long to appear,
the associated host devices might already be obsolete!

Still, a busy three days, and no doubt the timing of the NCTA filing vs. all
of the Slashdot attention to the issue was just an amusing coincidence.

Lauren Weinstein's Blog Update: More Wikipedia "Gotcha" Silliness
                        August 18, 2007

  <a href="http://lauren.vortex.com/archive/000270.html">http://lauren.vortex.com/archive/000270.html</a>

My concerns regarding the Wikipedia operational model are fairly well known,
e.g., "Wikipedia and Responsibility"
  <a href="http://lauren.vortex.com/archive/000257.html">http://lauren.vortex.com/archive/000257.html</a>

So it was with considerable interest that I've noted the controversy
regarding a 24-year-old self-described "disruptive technologist," and his
tool to more easily track the origin of Wikipedia changes (*The New York
Times*, "Lifting Corporate Fingerprints From the Editing of Wikipedia").
  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/19/technology/19wikipedia.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/19/technology/19wikipedia.html</a>

But even the title of that article tends to belie the underlying nature of a
real problem — the lack of accountability for most of what's written or
edited in Wikipedia.  The "Corporate Fingerprints" bit is cute — but what
about all of the other fingerprints smeared through virtually every byte of
the Wikipedia database?

Apparently it's one thing to snicker about corporate folks who want to
correct what they perceive as errors (or, indeed, put their own positive
spin on "the facts.") But there seems to be little interest in figuring out
who purposely defaces pages, plants false or defaming information in the
first place, or for that matter is responsible for the more mundane,
probably factual minutiae, even just for the sake of establishing
authenticity or expertise.

Wikipedia seems to be turning into a gigantic "gotcha" machine --
increasingly contaminated like a chunk of "Silly Putty" that's been used
once too often to pick up comic strip images.

The single best thing that Wikipedia could do to lend itself genuine
credibility would be to require that contributers identify themselves — by
name, not by handles or childish aliases.  Or, as an alternative, at the
very least clearly indicate "in-line" when unauthenticated text dominates an
entry.

Ironically, our disruptive technologist's tracing mechanism will probably
have ever less value moving forward from today.  While it will continue to
be useful for retrospective analysis up to this point in time, we can be
sure that more and more of the primarily targeted corporate Wikipedia
editors will learn their lesson.

That lesson being, if you're going to edit your entry on Wikipedia, be sure
to do it through a proxy or generic ISP account, not through your corporate
network.

So moving forward, we'll probably have even less meaningful transparency
concerning Wikipedia changes, and that Silly Putty Syndrome will likely
continue to escalate.

Given what Wikipedia could aspire to be, that's really a shame.

One of the risks of replacing frequent leap-seconds and thus the
frequent need to handle them with infrequent leap-hours is that handling
them becomes an unusual task.

We're never as good with unusual tasks as we are with the usual tasks.
Practice makes perfect!

With the requirement to add a leap second every few years systems have
to be designed to handle them as part of their normal operation.

If we have to add a leap hour every 100 years or so, we'll have Y2K date
problems every time. The same old excuses will be rolled out :

   We never expected this system to have to handle leap hours when we
   built it.

Since leap seconds come around every few years any system that is to
keep accurate time has to deal with them head on as part of the basic
design.

From the linked post, "copying and pasting what looks to be '0123456989'

From that I'd assume that internal calculations would still be correct and
that only the displaying of results would be corrupt.  It is still a

%T   "Security Metrics: Replacing Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt"

In the Foreword, Dan Geer states that the book is not about selling the idea
of metrics.  Which makes the initial chapters a bit problematic: if they
aren't about selling the idea of metrics, what are they about?  Chapter one
is supposed to be an introduction, but seems primarily focused on the idea
that metrics are not about risk management.  (There is also an assertion
that proper metrics are "well understood across industries, and consistently
measured," which is interesting because much of what follows appears to
contradict this statement.)  The definition of security metrics, in chapter
two, addresses metrics from fields other than security, and emphasizes the
position that metrics are important (and that the current "metrics," such as
checklist frameworks and annualized loss expectancy, are inadequate).
Chapter three divides metrics into four general areas, dealing with
perimeter security, control, availability, and applications development.
Brief examples of collections of metrics related to these fields are given
in the text, although the lists can't be expected to be comprehensive, due
to the huge scope of security as a whole.  The second of these topics,
control, is probably the subject of chapter four, although it is entitled
"Measuring Program Effectiveness."  Basic concepts from statistics, such as
the difference between mean (average) and median (midpoint of a set of
elements), are presented in chapter five.  Chapter six talks about
demonstrating data in a visual manner.  Most of the material consists of
suggestions for graphics and examples are given "redrawing" the displays of
commercial programs.  Aspects of automating the calculations of security
metrics are outlined in chapter seven.  In chapter eight, Jaquith recommends
the use of a security scorecard based on the Balanced Scorecard management
assessment model.

Security can be difficult to define, let alone measure, and, in general, too
little attention is paid to numeric assessments that can assist in
determining how well we are performing at the task.  This book does go
somewhat beyond a mere exhortation to create and use metrics for security,
but it still leaves an awful lot of work for the practitioner or manager.

  [The need for incisive security metrics has been with us for a long time.
  On the other hand, the metrics that have emerged tend to be local rather
  than system-wide, and these local metrics are not easily composed into
  system-wide metrics.  Even the metrics for algorithmic crypto strength are
  relatively unsatisfying when the crypto is poorly implemented or embedded
  in systems that are easily compromised — whether by insiders or outsiders.
  Thus, the quest for meaningful system-level security metrics that can be
  derived from lower-layer metrics remains an enormously difficult
  challenge.  PGN]
