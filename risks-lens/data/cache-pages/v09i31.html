&gt;From the 'Los Angeles Times' 2-Oct-89:

Hundreds of independent employees who worked for Wells Fargo Co. two years ago
were stunned to learn of a computer error that multiplied their earnings by 100
before passing on the information to the Internal Revenue Service.  The IRS,
eager to collect Uncle Sam's share, has written to the taxpayers, demanding an
explanation for the discrepancies between the Wells Fargo reports and the
recipients' 1987 tax returns.  "I was panicked.  They moved the decimal point
two places to the right," real estate appraiser Harold M. Samuelson told the
Salinas Californian.

This item, taken from "Computing Australia" 2nd October, should warm
the cockles of a few hearts...

``Hackwatch spokesman charged

  Self-styled computer security expert Paul Dummett, alias Stuart Gill,
  has been charged with making false reports to the Victoria Police
  following an investigation into claims he made in the daily media late
  in 1988 and early this year.  The articles often quoted Gill,
  introducing himself as a spokesman for either "Hackwatch" or the "DPG
  monitoring service".

  Gill claimed hackers in Australia had gained access codes from others
  in the US and lifted $US500,000 from the International Citibank, US.
  Other claims: credit card numbers had been posted on bulletin boards
  for BBS users' access; drugs, including steroids, were being sold
  using bulletin boards; evidence of this had benn given to the police
  by informers; and in response, the police had raided several hackers'
  homes.  The police, including the Criminal Investigation Bureau and the
  Fraud Squad's Computer Section, repeatedly denied the claims.

  Gill had disappeared, but returned again on September 22 and was
  charged in the Frankston Magistrates' Court under his real name, Paul
  Dummett.  According to court documents, police investigating Dummett's
  claims allegedly found Citibank's computer network had not been
  illegally accessed on its New York number as Dummett had claimed.
  When Dummett appeared in court his legal aid counsel Serge Sztrajt
  applied successfully to adjourn the case to October 20.  Dummett did
  not enter a plea.''

We have also been hit by this person. We managed to trace some of his
activities. He broke into an account that saved it's history file and
we saw some of what he did to get root access. **** THERE IS A SECURITY
HOLE IN V3.0 ULTRIX **** This hole is fixed in 3.1. This problem has not
been mentioned in any DEC communications we have received. If you are
running 3.0 and this person can break into a normal account, he can get
root access with no trouble.

The base time for VAX/VMS is November 17, 1858 (which is the base of the
Modified Julian Day system).  VAX/VMS uses 63-bit absolute time
representation (negative values are delta time representations) with a 100
nanosecond granularity therefore the last absolute time value that can be
represented is:

However, all date/time routines within VAX/VMS allow for only 4 digits for
the year field so after 31-DEC-9999 the year field will look like

&gt;It has been suggested that if the year is divisible by 4000 then it
&gt;should NOT be considered a leap-year.  Anyone writing code thats likley
&gt;to be around 2000 years hence???

This is actually just a specific manifestation of the fact that calendar
reform requires altering timekeeping programs to match.  Leap millennia
are *not* officially part of the calendar, last I heard; anyone who writes
code on that basis has goofed.

I do recall some amusing ads for digital watches (back when they were new)
whose timekeeping was guaranteed accurate to the year 2099.  That is, the
designers didn't feel like allowing for leap centuries, and lucked out on the
year 2000 following the same rules as normal leap years.

In <a href="/Risks/9/30">Risks Digest 9.30</a> Randall Davis decries the practice of transmitting
an image of a clock:

&gt; Thousands of TVs?  An expensive television camera doing nothing but
&gt; sitting there focused on a clock?  All those cables, monitors, all that
&gt; power, bandwidth to burn on the network, etc.?

What a waste of resources indeed!  That expensive equipment was meant for
Geraldo Rivera, "Roseanne," and reruns of "Family Ties"--not for frivolous
ends.

I can't wait till we have high-definition television....

A recent report "Macintosh S/W markets: productivity S/W review &amp; forecast,
1998-1993" (International Data Corp, 8/89) predicts that, in 1993, the U.S will
buy so many millions, nine hundred twenty-nine thusand, five hundred AND
FIFTEEN dollars' worth of Mac word-processing software. The leading digits have
been suppressed to protect the publisher's interests; but given that all nine
digits have been published, I wouldn't trust them that far anyway. This is a
reasonably expensive report (a few hundred $) which probably affects a good
many high-level management decisions.

I think this tomfoolery is relevant to comp.risks on two grounds: (1) it's a
textbook demo of common sense abdicating in the face of "the computer says so";
(2) I was told "that's Excel's default-mode for output" (and — I think --
other spreadsheets' too).

I was also told "that's what they learn in business school!". I hope not.

On the day that New Jersey Transit inaugurated service to Atlantic City, there
was a grade crossing accident that provoked a discussion of crossing gate
technology on the newsgroup rec.railroad.  It is interesting to note how an
"old" industry operating in difficult conditions (equipment outside, subject to
all sorts of environmental problems, not to mention vandalism) solves a safety
problem.
                                        Chuck Weinstock

&gt;From: beyer@holin.ATT.COM (Jean-David Beyer)

I have some notes from General Railway Signal Company on railroad signalling.
There are separate sections on Wayside Signals, Crossing Gate Signalling,
Cab Signals, Frequency Shift Overlay Signalling, and so on.

The stuff is fool-proof, but not damn-fool proof. It cannot keep people
from going around crossing gates.

If the power source of signalling goes out, signals fail to stop.  If rails
break, signals fail to stop. If vandals short out the rails, signals go to
stop. If insulating joints fail to insulate, signals go to stop. If relays
springs break, signals go to stop. If relay coils open, signals go to stop. If
a lamp burns out, this is detected and the least restrictive aspect more
restrictive than desired is displayed.  Get the idea?

However, a suitably well-informed vandal could break the rail, having
previously put heavy electrical bonds around the gap, and wreck a train.

Or he could make his own code transmitters and couple them into the
rails (after disabling the real ones). But it is a lot of trouble to
do this without attracting the notice of the dispatcher.

Basically, when things go wrong, they fail safe. Even when someone around here
bumped an extruded aluminum crossing gate so that when it went up it hit the
12500 volt 1500 ampere catenary. It melted the gate and fried a couple of
relays in the control bungalow. The gates stayed down until that was fixed.  On
the other hand, if the gates stay down longer than an unreasonable driver
thinks is a reasonable time, he will go around the gate and get hit by a train.
Sometimes a train is coming the other way from one that is stopped in a
station, such as at Bridge and Monmouth streets in Red Bank. An eastbound train
was stopped in the station with the intersection apparently clear.  The driver
could not wait a few seconds (less than 60) for the train to pull out and
started around the gate. Only then did he see the westbound train and stop
clear of the other track. That is the kind of damn-fool proof the system is not.

Engineers must assume a signal improperly displayed is displaying the most
restrictive aspect that the signal is capable of (under most conditions).  Car
drivers should assume that if a gate is down, that they do not have time to get
around the gates. Sometimes they do, but it is a dumb thing to bet your life on.

&gt; From: lsheldon@cup.portal.com (Laurence Larry Sheldon)

On the SP Penninsula Line (and others--it seems like) there is a white light
that shines down the right-of-way in each direction--if it is a bells and
lights only crossing, the light blinks in concert with one of the red lights
(in many cases it is a lens in the side of the red lights case).

If there is a gate, the white light does not flash unless the gate is down.

There seems to be a rule that the train must stop (or maybe it's run dead-slow)
if the white light is not blinking.

This is based on observation, not knowledge of the facts.

&gt; From: lsheldon@cup.portal.com (Laurence Larry Sheldon)

On the SP again--if a train stops at a station (or in areas where switching
activity is high) the gates open up again if the train does not cross within
some time limit.  The engineer has to "whistle" the gate back down (there are
post-mounted microphones--actually loudspeakers-used-as- microphones) before
proceeding.  On some non-main line tracks there is a "STOP" sign at the
pavement (White on rectangylar red)--when the train gets to the stop sign, the
gates come down.

&gt; From: beyer@cbnewsh.ATT.COM (jean-david.beyer)

G.R.S. have some motion detector circuits available. I do not know if they use
doppler detectors, or rate of change of signal amplitude, or what.  But they
are used where there is a lot of switching activity near a grade crossing. If a
train starts toward a crossing at over 2 mph, the gates come down. If the train
stops, the gates go back up. If the train resumes, the gates come down again.
If the train reverses (goes away from the intersection), the gates stay up.
Costly enough that they are not used much around here. But there is little
switching on the NJ Coast Line.

I have been told that some such units estimate the speed of the train, and wait
a while before putting the gates down if the train is coming slowly. This seems
theoretically possible, but I have seen no written information about that.

&gt; From: beyer@holin.ATT.COM (Jean-David Beyer)

None of the Operating Rules I have read (but I have only about a 1974 Central
Railroad of New Jersey and a NORAC from early 1988) specifically discuss such
lights.
