<p>
Mistakes and lessons learned from medical practitioners that may resonate
with comp.risks readers.
</p>
<p>
1) “On how the checklist system used in medicine was adapted from aviation”
</p>
<p>
“In the aviation industry, there was a whole development of the process
called “the checklist.” And some people date this back to 1935 when a very
complex [Boeing] B-17 [Flying] Fortress was being tested with the head of
the military aviation division. And it exploded, and the pilot unfortunately
died. And when they analyzed what happened, they realized that the high-tech
airplane was so complex that a human being could not keep track of
everything. And that even if he was the smartest, most experienced pilot, it
was just too much and you were bound to have an error. And so they developed
the idea of making a checklist to make sure that every single thing you have
to check is done. And so it put more of the onus on a system, of checking up
on the system, rather than the pilot to keep track of everything. And the
checklist quickly decreased the adverse events and bad outcomes in the
aviation industry.”
</p>
<p>
The interview stream continues with “On how the checklist system did not
result in improved safety outcomes when implemented in Canadian operating
rooms” reveals how checklists can compromise safety.
</p>
<p>
Software stack release life cycle and ecosystem-wide deployment (aka change
management) are governed by standard operating procedures and checklists to
guide governance readiness based on must-fix versus ‘deferred or exempt from
fix, add to release notes’ to ‘kick bits out the door’ for sale.
</p>
<p>
Ecosystem deployment checklists cannot do not guarantee an organization
against data breach or ransomware incidents. Public data privacy stewardship
and effective computer ecosystem protections are traded for profit. Law
enforcement pursues cybercriminals more than owners/operators of deployed
platforms recognized as vulnerable to burgeoning risk perimeters and
recurrent incidents.
</p>
<p>
2) “Electronic medical records”
</p>
<p>
“[Electronic medical records] really started as a method for billing, for
interfacing with insurance companies and medical billing with diagnosis
codes. And that's the origin. And then it kind of retroactively was expanded
to include the patient care. And so you see that difference now.”
</p>
<p>
A solution scoped to expedite fee-for-service billing (revenue capture and
realization) transitions into the doctor's office and compromises patient
care. EHRs transform physicians into point-of-sale entry clerks to reduce
back-end corporate expenses (aka overhead). EHR deployment transition
diminishes nationwide healthcare effectiveness.

the ransomware variant—dubbed “EvilQuest”—is packaged along with
legitimate apps, which upon installation, disguises itself as Apple's
CrashReporter or Google Software Update.
</p>
<p>
Besides encrypting the victim's files, EvilQuest also comes with
capabilities to ensure persistence, log keystrokes, create a reverse shell,
and steal cryptocurrency wallet-related files.
</p>
<p>
With this development, EvilQuest joins a handful of ransomware strains that
have exclusively singled out macOS, including KeRanger

As the old joke goes, the ‘S’ in ‘IoT’ stands for security. While (Internet
of) Things can vary <em>wildly</em> in design robustness and overall security, many
embedded devices nowadays have at least the basic protections in place.
Happily, the egregious security mistakes of the past are now becoming less
and less common. Despite the stereotype, Things in the IoT aren't quite as
bad as they used to be (pun intended).

For instance, the use of insecure communications (e.g., unencrypted HTTP),
is now only found in a minority of Bishop Fox client product assessments,
which gives a somewhat positive (and admittedly biased) picture of IoT
security trends. In a twist of irony, the increasingly common implementation
of encrypted communications to repel attackers is also an obstacle for pen
testers assessing the security of the products, since the data is now hidden
to everyone but the client and server. Overall, it's a win for security, but
it's required us to develop new tactics for getting into that data.
</p>
<p>
In my time at Bishop Fox, I've had to overcome this problem on many, many
hardware assessments, with Things ranging from consumer gadgets to
networking equipment to Internet-connected industrial control systems.
Regardless of the specific implementation, the goal at the start of every
assessment is the same: decrypt HTTPS traffic so I can understand what the
system is doing and why. Once I have this understanding, I can begin to
attack the device itself, upstream services, and sometimes even other
devices.
</p>
<p>
In this post I'll show you three attack techniques for performing Man-in-the
Middle attacks against production-grade, HTTPS-protected Things.  For these
examples, we'll assume you're redirecting all the device's traffic through
an HTTPS-aware proxy (like Burp), and that you have no administrative
control over the device. All you have at the start is a view of the
unintelligible encrypted stream, showcasing the full spectrum of unprintable
ASCII characters: […]

<blockquote>
  Researchers from Ruhr-Universität Bochum (RUB) and the Bochum Max Planck
  Institute (MPI) for Cybersecurity and Privacy have investigated which
  words inadvertently activate voice assistants. They compiled a list of
  English, German, and Chinese terms that were repeatedly misinterpreted by
  various smart speakers as prompts. Whenever the systems wake up, they
  record a short sequence of what is being said and transmit the data to the
  manufacturer. The audio snippets are then transcribed and checked by
  employees of the respective corporation. Thus, fragments of very private
  conversations can end up in the companies' systems.

  Süddeutsche Zeitung and NDR reported on the results of the analysis on 30
  June 2020. Examples yielded by the researchers' analysis can be found at

<p>
<em>Police monitored a hundred million encrypted messages sent through
Encrochat, a network used by career criminals to discuss drug deals,
murders, and extortion plots.</em>
</p>
<p>
Something wasn't right. Starting earlier this year, police kept arresting
associates of Mark, a UK-based alleged drug dealer. Mark took the security
of his operation seriously, with the gang using code names to discuss
business on custom, encrypted phones made by a company called Encrochat.
For legal reasons, Motherboard is referring to Mark using a pseudonym.
</p>
<p>
Because the messages were encrypted on the devices themselves, police
couldn't tap the group's phones or intercept messages as authorities
normally would. On Encrochat, criminals spoke openly and negotiated their
deals in granular detail, with price lists, names of customers, and explicit
references to the large quantities of drugs they sold, according to
documents obtained by Motherboard from sources in and around the criminal
world.
</p>
<p>
Maybe it was a coincidence, but in the same time frame, police across the UK
and Europe busted a wide range of criminals. In mid-June, authorities picked
up an alleged member of another drug gang.
&lt;<a href="https://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2020/06/18/news/court-hears-police-uncovered-evidence-of-large-scale-supply-and-importation-of-drugs-on-encrypted-phone-1977585/">https://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2020/06/18/news/court-hears-police-uncovered-evidence-of-large-scale-supply-and-importation-of-drugs-on-encrypted-phone-1977585/</a><i class="shield fad fa-shield"></i><i class="fad fa-flashlight flashlight"></i>
</p>
<p>
A few days later, law enforcement seized millions of dollars worth of
illegal drugs in Amsterdam. It was as if the police were detaining people
from completely unrelated gangs simultaneously.  “[The police] all over it
aren't they,” the dealer wrote in one of the messages obtained by
Motherboard. “My heads still baffled how they got on all my guys.”
&lt;<a href="https://www.thesun.ie/news/5564093/irish-crime-gangs-drugs-seized-oranges-melons/">https://www.thesun.ie/news/5564093/irish-crime-gangs-drugs-seized-oranges-melons/</a><i class="shield fad fa-shield"></i><i class="fad fa-flashlight flashlight"></i>&gt;
</p>
<p>
Unbeknownst to Mark, or the tens of thousands of other alleged Encrochat
users, their messages weren't really secure. French authorities had
penetrated the Encrochat network, leveraged that access to install a
technical tool in what appears to be a mass hacking operation, and had been
quietly reading the users' communications for months. Investigators then
shared those messages with agencies around Europe.
</p>
<p>
“I've never seen anything like this.”
</p>
<p>
Only now is the astonishing scale of the operation coming into focus: It
represents one of the largest law enforcement infiltrations of a
communications network predominantly used by criminals ever, with Encrochat
users spreading beyond Europe to the Middle East and elsewhere. French,
Dutch, and other European agencies monitored and investigated “more than a
hundred million encrypted messages” sent between Encrochat users in real
time, leading to arrests in the UK, Norway, Sweden, France, and the
Netherlands, a team of international law enforcement agencies announced
Thursday. […]

As services-based economies sweep every industry, it's time for the
automotive realm to carry on.
</p>
<p>
German luxury cars are renowned for the breadth of their options sheets. On
one hand, this means you can get your next BMW 5 Series
&lt;<a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/2021-bmw-5-series-hybrid-power-price-msrp/">https://www.cnet.com/news/2021-bmw-5-series-hybrid-power-price-msrp/</a><i class="shield fad fa-shield"></i><i class="fad fa-flashlight flashlight"></i>&gt;
configured exactly how you want it. On the other hand, it means you'll often
wind up paying for extra for seemingly basic things like, say, a spare tire.
Now, BMW is raising the ante by making many car options into software
services enabled whenever you want them. The disconcerting part? They can be
disabled, too.
</p>
<p>
In a VR presentation streamed from Germany today, BMW ran through a series
of digital updates to its cars, including more details on the new BMW
digital key &lt;<a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-car-keyless-entry-ios-bmw/">https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-car-keyless-entry-ios-bmw/</a><i class="shield fad fa-shield"></i><i class="fad fa-flashlight flashlight"></i>&gt;
service announced with Apple at last week's WWDC and confirming that current
model cars will be fully software upgradeable over the air, a la Tesla. The
first such update will hit BMW Operating System 7 cars in July. Packages are
said to be approximately 1GB in size and will take roughly 20 minutes to
install.
</p>
<p>
But, the most notable part of the day's presentation was the new plan to
turn many options into software services. BMW mentioned everything from
advanced safety systems like adaptive cruise and automatic high-beams to
other, more discrete options like heated seats.
</p>
<p>
These options will be enabled via the car or the new My BMW app. While some
will be permanent and assigned to the car, others will be temporary, with
mentioned periods ranging from three months to three years. Some,
presumably, will be permanent, but during the stream's Q&amp;A portion BMW
representatives demurred on the details.
</p>
<p>
So, yes, you could theoretically only pay for heated seats in the colder
months if you like, or perhaps save a few bucks by only enabling automatic
high-beams on those seasons when the days are shortest. […]

Conspiracy theories have driven people to burn cellular equipment. Telecom
workers have had to bear the brunt of this.
</p>
<p>
Telephone engineer David Snowdon was just returning to his van after an
assignment repairing a cell site when a car sped past him, spun around and
stopped right in front of him. Two men got out of the vehicle and asked him
if he had anything to do with 5G &lt;<a href="https://www.cnet.com/5g/">https://www.cnet.com/5g/</a><i class="shield fad fa-shield"></i><i class="fad fa-flashlight flashlight"></i>&gt; masts.
</p>
<p>
“You better not be or there will be f*cking trouble,” said one of the men,
before kicking the door of Snowdon's van, smacking the mirror around and
walking off.
</p>
<p>
Initially, the 56-year-old from Birmingham in the UK's Midlands region
thought that what he experienced was an isolated incident. Then he did some
research.
</p>
<p>
“The next day, I went onto Facebook and there it all was, this big 5G
conspiracy,” he said in a phone call with CNET. “I thought, I better report
this, and when I reported it to our security team, they went, ‘Yeah,
there's been quite a few.’”
</p>
<p>
Over the past four months, telecom engineers across the UK have been
subjected to verbal and physical abuse, or targeted online harassment and
doxxing. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued a warning
&lt;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/dhs-to-advise-telecom-firms-on-preventing-5g-cell-tower-attacks-linked-to-coronavirus-conspiracy-theories/2020/05/13/6aa9eaa6-951f-11ea-82b4-c8db161ff6e5_story.html">https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/dhs-to-advise-telecom-firms-on-preventing-5g-cell-tower-attacks-linked-to-coronavirus-conspiracy-theories/2020/05/13/6aa9eaa6-951f-11ea-82b4-c8db161ff6e5_story.html</a><i class="shield fad fa-shield"></i><i class="fad fa-flashlight flashlight"></i>&gt;
to carriers about potential threat to wireless equipment here. All because
some people are buying into the conspiracy theory that 5G is to blame for
the coronavirus

pandemic, something that popped up just as the disease spread beyond China
in January.
</p>
<p>
5G has been a target of conspiracy theorists for as long as it's been
around, just as with 4G and 3G before it. But what's different this time
around is that people started linking it in various ways to COVID-19, saying
either that the technology weakens immune systems, or even that it's
responsible for directly transmitting the virus.
</p>
<p>
Scientists around the world are in agreement that all such claims are
categorically false. […]

“Even before the global pandemic, waiting in line to get prescriptions
filled in a pharmacy was a pain. Enter NowRx, a company that started in the
Bay Area and expanded to Orange County with sights on extending its reach to
other regions of the state and Arizona.”
</p>
<p>
“The company claims it has 99% of the pharmaceuticals typically found at
brick-and-mortar pharmacies (and online) and can deliver medication to you
on the day or sometimes hours after your doctor submits a prescription.”
</p>
<p>
Pharmacists fulfill an essential role: trained to decipher a physician's
enciphered scrawl, they also alert patients to dangerous interactions among
prescriptions possibly overlooked by their doctor. One website that
identifies them is drug interaction checker:
<a href="https://reference.medscape.com/drug-interactionchecker">https://reference.medscape.com/drug-interactionchecker</a><i class="shield fad fa-shield"></i><i class="fad fa-flashlight flashlight"></i>.
</p>
<p>
NowRX dispenses with consultation. Pharmacists have become too expensive and
slow: they fill only ~100/day per person with an unacceptable error
rate. The robo-pharmacist pushes prescriptions out at ~2000/day with
substantially suppressed error occurrence.
</p>
<p>
Will robo-pharmacists automatically identify physicians that over-prescribe
opioids and notify the DEA? If NowRX dispenses incorrectly, and the medicine
severely injures the patient, do their Terms of Service state the equivalent
of “by accepting delivery, you agree to indemnify against error or injury
after consuming or using said prescription(s)…”

<p>
This time last year, Jaggar Henry was enjoying the summer like so many other
teens. The 17-year-old had a job, was hanging out with friends on the
weekends, and was just generally spending a lot of time online. But then, at
the end of July, Henry combed his hair, donned a slightly oversized Oxford
shirt, and appeared before his school district's board

of the larger school districts in the United States—to outline a slew of
security flaws he had found in its digital systems. His presentation was the
culmination of months of work and focused on software used by more than
100,000 students.

School districts in the United States already had significant cybersecurity
shortcomings. They often lack dedicated funding and skilled personnel to
continuously vet and improve cybersecurity defenses. As a result, many
schools make basic system-setup errors or leave old vulnerabilities
unpatched—essentially propping a door open for hackers and scammers.
Schools and students also face potential exposure from third-party
education-technology firms that fail to adequately secure data in their
platforms. […]

Just as we're dealing with one coronavirus epidemic, researchers are finding
the virus has mutated to become an even faster infection machine.  “A global
study has found strong evidence that a new form of the coronavirus has
spread from Europe to the U.S. The new mutation makes the virus more likely
to infect people but does not seem to make them any sicker than earlier
variations of the virus, an international team of researchers reported
Thursday,” says CNN.
&lt;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/02/health/coronavirus-mutation-spread-study/index.html">https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/02/health/coronavirus-mutation-spread-study/index.html</a><i class="shield fad fa-shield"></i><i class="fad fa-flashlight flashlight"></i>&gt;
</p>
<p>
“It is now the dominant form infecting people,” Erica Ollmann Saphire of the
La Jolla Institute for Immunology and the Coronavirus Immunotherapy
Consortium, who worked on the study, told CNN. “This is now the virus.”
</p>
<p>
How They Discovered the Mutation
</p>
<p>
“The study, <em>published in the journal Cell</em>,
&lt;<a href="https://www.cell.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0092-8674(20)30820-5">https://www.cell.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0092-8674(20)30820-5</a><i class="shield fad fa-shield"></i><i class="fad fa-flashlight flashlight"></i>&gt; builds
on some earlier work the team did that was <em>released on a preprint server</em>
&lt;<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.29.069054v1">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.29.069054v1</a><i class="shield fad fa-shield"></i><i class="fad fa-flashlight flashlight"></i>&gt; earlier in the
year. Shared information on genetic sequences had indicated that a certain
mutant version of the virus was taking over,” reports CNN. “Now the team has
not only checked more genetic sequences, but they have also run experiments
involving people, animals and cells in lab dishes that show the mutated
version is more common and that it's more infectious than other versions.”
</p>
<p>
Bette Korber, a theoretical biologist at Los Alamos National Laboratory and
lead author of the study, noted, “The D614G variant first came to our
attention in early April, as we had observed a strikingly repetitive
pattern. All over the world, even when local epidemics had many cases of
the original form circulating, soon after the D614G variant was introduced
into a region it became the prevalent form.”
</p>
<p>
“It's remarkable to me,” commented Will Fischer of Los Alamos, an author on
the study, according to <em>Science Daily</em>
&lt;<a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/07/200702144054.htm">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/07/200702144054.htm</a><i class="shield fad fa-shield"></i><i class="fad fa-flashlight flashlight"></i>&gt;, “both
that this increase in infectivity was detected by careful observation of
sequence data alone, and that our experimental colleagues could confirm it
with live virus in such a short time.”
Focused on the Immune Response
</p>
<p>
“We are focused on the human immune response because LJI is the
headquarters for the Coronavirus Immunotherapy Consortium (CoVIC), a global
collaboration to understand and advance antibody treatments against the
virus,” says Saphire, who leads the Gates Foundation-supported CoVIC.
“Saphire explains that viruses regularly acquire mutations to help them
‘escape’ antibodies made by the human immune system. When a virus acquires
many of these individual changes, it ‘drifts’ away from the original virus.
Researchers call this phenomenon ‘antigenic drift.’ Antigenic drift is part
of the reason you need a new flu shot each year,” reports <em>MedicalXpress</em>
&lt;<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-07-mutation-coronavirus-dominate-globe.html">https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-07-mutation-coronavirus-dominate-globe.html</a><i class="shield fad fa-shield"></i><i class="fad fa-flashlight flashlight"></i>&gt;.
“It is extremely important for researchers to track <em>antigenic drift</em>
&lt;<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/antigenic+drift/">https://medicalxpress.com/tags/antigenic+drift/</a><i class="shield fad fa-shield"></i><i class="fad fa-flashlight flashlight"></i>&gt; as they design vaccines

ACM Bulletin Archives, 1 Jul 2020
</p>
<p>
Barbara Simons was named the recipient of the 2019 ACM Policy Award for
long-standing, high-impact leadership as ACM President and founding Chair of
ACM's U.S. Public Policy Committee (USACM, now USTPC), while making
influential contributions to improve the reliability of and public
confidence in election technology. Over several decades, Simons has advanced
technology policy by founding and leading organizations, authoring
influential publications, and effecting change through lobbying and public
education.
</p>
<p>
Now part of ACM's Technology Policy Council (TPC), which serves global
regions, the TPC groups have continued Simons' original vision for ACM: to
provide cogent advice and analysis to legislators and policymakers about a
wide range of issues including cryptography, computer security, privacy, and
intellectual property.
</p>
<p>
Simons is internationally known as an expert on voting technology, an
advocate for auditable paper-based voting systems, and author of numerous
papers on secure election technology. Through her publications, reports,
testimony to the U.S. Congress, and advocacy, Simons has been a key player
in persuading election officials to shift to paper-based voting systems, and
has contributed to proposals for reforms in election technologies.
</p>
<p>
Simons served as ACM President from 1998 to 2000. Since 2008, Simons has
served as one of two U.S. Senate appointees to the Board of Advisors of the
U.S. Election Assistance Commission, and she was named Chair of the Board of
Advisors subcommittee on election security in 2019. She currently also
chairs the Board of Directors of Verified Voting, a nonpartisan nonprofit
organization that advocates for legislation and regulation that promotes
accuracy, transparency and verifiability of elections. She remains active
with ACM as a member of the global Technology Policy Council and as Co-chair
of USTPC's Voting subcommittee.

The cause of the “billions” appears if you follow the trail to Intel: you
find the stack embedded in management firmware in what appear to be many
common (all PC?) products; Intel's statement that products for which no
future releases were planned are out of support and were not evaluated for
any vulnerabilities; and issued it's own “CVEs” separate from the published
“CVEs”.
</p>
<p>
Besides possible attempts at minimization, on the heels of ongoing
announcements of new speculative execution vulnerabilities, mitigation
microcode update issuances, withdrawals, and redos, I thought the whole
point of the “CVE” database was for orgs to reuse existing ids, to simplify
checking for existence of vulnerabilities and application of mitigation, not
have to provide a “CVE” cross-reference table in a security announcement
rated <em>CRITICAL</em>, covering what appears to be a number of organizational
management components in many devices:

I live in a small suburban community in Ventura County, a five-minute walk
from the Los Angeles County line and about 10 miles from the western edge of
the city of Los Angeles.  The population is less than 15,000.  Our water is
not well water.  Instead, it is snow melt from northern California.  For
Ventura and Los Angeles Counties, the California State Water Project
aqueduct ends in the north end of the city of Los Angeles, where it is
filtered, chlorinated, and fluoridated at the Jensen Treatment Plant.  From
there, Ventura County's portion is piped to the Bard Reservoir.  As it
leaves the Bard Reservoir—and only at that location—the water is again
filtered, chlorinated, and thoroughly tested.  It is also treated with ozone
to treat organics (live or otherwise) that might pass through the filters or
be immune to chlorine.  It is then piped without further exposure to the
environment to my house and to over 250,000 people in adjacent areas,
</p>
<p>
Similar processes are involved in distributing water elsewhere in Ventura
County and in Los Angeles County.  Nasadowski made generalizations about
water that do not apply to a very large population in the United States.

It's even worse than that; the speed of propagation in a fiber optic cable
is only ~2/3 of the speed in a vacuum—i.e., ~2/3c.  This is one of the
reasons why some High Frequency Traders (HFT's) want laser- based ‘free
space’ communications links to provide lower latency.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps lies propagate faster by means of quantum ‘spooky lying at a
distance’?  Perhaps via the collapse of the ‘hand wave’ function?

﻿Regarding Fred Cohen's detailed calculation, for which I thank him, I will
merely say in defence of my hyperbole that neither William Shakespeare nor I
indicated along which line of longitude (or latitude) lay the course of the
