In <a href="/Risks/3/51">RISKS 3.51</a> Bill Janssen writes of errors made in failing to consider
the interaction of the hardware and the software under design.  This
failing was all too common in the writing of assembly and machine code 
during the early days of programming.  Discrete wired machines often had
OP codes that were not generally well known (i.e. the computer designers
kept it secret).  Interestingly, these unknown OP codes were included when
more modern machines emulated the original discrete design.  An excellent 
example is the old IBM 4-PI CP-3 and the IBM 360.  

The hardware/software interface within the machine can create significant
problems from both a software safety and software security standpoint.  
Software designers will have to have an increasingly detailed knowledge of
the total system to produce the safe, secure software that critical systems
will require.

Perhaps a solution is to remind the pilots not to attempt obviously destruc-
tive maneuvers however, relying on procedures to eliminate or reduce the
risk of hazards is the least acceptable way.  Pilots are human and as such
are prone to making errors.  Look at the safety record for general aviation
and the Navy - both are dismal and are often reported to be due to pilot
error.  Its fine to tell the pilot "Lower your wheels before you land, not
after" but we still have gear up landings.  We should not concern ourselves
with checking for and preventing any incorrect behavior but we should preclude
that behavior which will result in damage to or loss of the aircraft or the
pilot.  We do not need to anticipate every possible mistake that he can make
in this regard either - all we need to do are to identify the hazardous operational modes and prevent
their occurrence.

    I detect a notion floating about that software should

    an interstate highway?

I certainly agree with the thrust of this.  But we should note that there is
plenty of evidence that coding in prohibitions on unreasonable behavior will
be required, particularly in the development of "autonomous" weapons that
are meant to combat the enemy without human "operators" on the scene.

Here's a description of a contract let by the United States Army Training and
Doctrine Command (TRADOC), Field Artillery Division, for something called a
"Terminal Homing Munition" (THM):

    Information about targets can be placed into the munitions
    processor prior to firing along with updates on meteorologi-
    cal conditions and terrain.  Warhead functioning can also be
    selected as variable options will be available.  The intro-
    duction of VHSIC processors will give the terminal homing
    munitions the capability of distinguishing between enemy and
    friendly systems and finite target type selection.  Since
    the decision of which target to attack is made on board the
    weapon, the THM will approach human intelligence in this area.
    The design criteria is pointed toward one munition per target
    kill.

(I scratched my head along with the rest of you when I saw this;  I've always
thought if you fire a bullet or a shell out of a tube it goes until it hits
something, preferably something you're aiming at.  But maybe the Army has
some new theories of ballistics we don't know about yet.)

As Nancy Leveson notes, we make tradeoffs in design and functionality for
safety, and how many and what kinds of tradeoffs are made depends on ethical,
political and cost considerations, among other things.  Since, as Jon Jacky
notes, trying to prohibit all unreasonable situations in code is itself un-
reasonable, then one wonders what sorts of things will be left out of the code
of terminal homing munitions?  What sorts of things will we have to take into
account in the code of a "warhead" that is supposed to find its own targets?
What level of confidence would we have to give soldiers (human soldiers--we
may have to get used to using that caveat) operating at close proximity to
THMs that the things are "safe"?

I was once a participant in an artillery briefing by a young, smart artillery
corps major.  This officer told us (a bunch of grunts) that we no longer needed
"forward observers," or guys attached to patrols to call in the ranges on
artillery strikes.  In fact, said the major, we don't need to call in our
artillery stikes at all--his methods had become so advanced  would
just know where and when we needed support.  We all looked at him like he had
gone stark raving mad.  An old grizzled master sergeant who had been in the Army
since Valley Forge I think, got up and said, "Sir, with all due respect, if I
find out you're in charge of the artillery in my sector, I will personally come
back and shoot you right between the eyes."  (His own form of THM "approaching
human intelligence", no doubt.) (I wouldn't be surprised if this major wrote
the language above.)

What is "unreasonable" behavior to take into account in coding software?  The
major's or the sergeant's?

&gt; From: mogul@decwrl.DEC.COM (Jeffrey Mogul)

&gt; I don't often shop at that market, partly because the markets I do use
&gt; have cashiers who know what things are rather than relying on the
&gt; computer. Some day, just for fun, I might mark a pound of pecans with
&gt; the code number for walnuts, and see if I can save some money.
----------
Does the word "fraud" mean anything to you?

Even if your pet cashier can tell at sight a pound of peanuts from a pound
of walnuts, I don't see any reason to assume he would know what the correct
price of either was or even which was more expensive on a particular day.
The cashier is just as dependent on price stickers in a piece marked store
as the scanner is on the UPC label in a scanner store.

If I were designing a cash register, I'd make sure it could retain the
current session through a power outage (no re-ringing the stuff already in
the bags), but I don't think I'd require it to work while the power was off.
Personally, if I were in a store when the power went out, I would leave
quickly.  If power loss is COMMON in the area where the store is built, the
designers should work around it (perhaps by providing battery-powered
scanners or emergency backup power); in my neighborhood I think it's
reasonable to write off as a minor inconvenience — the speed and efficiency
of the scanners when the power is on is a more than reasonable trade for the
inconvenience the tiny part of the time it isn't.
