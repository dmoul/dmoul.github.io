Summary: NZ's new "Electronic Operating Model" for courts is late and
over budget; staff appear to have been mismanaged; and the government
has already closed some courts in anticipation of benefits from a
system that may not operate until next year.

Justice Minister Judith Collins announced in 2011 that the NZ Government was
"amending criminal procedure to bring [the justice system] up to date with
[the] 21st century... Within the District Sourts, around 60% of criminal
procedures will be new or changed.  Where old law required paper records,
the Act allows use of technology to exchange information ..."  The
"Electronic Operating Model" was to be introduced "later in 2013", replacing
the current paper-based court record.  It was then estimated that charges
would be processed up to 70% faster and that the Ministry of Justice and
Police would be saved "around 93,000 hours a year". —Extracted from
  <a href="http://my.lawsociety.org.nz/news/electronic-operating-model-outlined">http://my.lawsociety.org.nz/news/electronic-operating-model-outlined</a>

I'm not sure when work started, but the "2010/11 estimates examination;
responses to the additional questions: Vote Courts" document, which is
missing from its home but still in Google's cache, suggests that it was
already in the 2010 budget, as part of a "Criminal Procedure Simplification
programme" that appears to have included paperwork streamlining as well as
computerisation.  This would be the Criminal Procedure Act 2011, described
as the "biggest reform of criminal procedure in 50 years", and "enabled an
electronic operating model:.

The same document says
 - the first phase will involve the electronic filing, management, and
   disposal of an estimated 270,000 charges/year from the Police; this would
   take about 2 years with the first charges processed by mid-2012.

 - costs were expected to be NZD 11.2 million capital and NZD 7.8 million
   operating expenses between 2010/11 and 2013/14.

 - benefits were expected to equal costs for the first phase.

 - the first phase was to "start establishing the platform for a wholly
   electronic criminal summary operating model", but was not yet to _be_
   that model.

If I'm reading the "Briefing for the Incoming Minister" correctly, that was
in the context of a total Vote Courts budget of NZD 438 million,

Quoting that document:

    The court system is one of the few examples of a significant national
    service delivery model that still relies predominantly on paper.  Given
    the technology available, a paper-based court record is resource
    intensive, cumbersome and inefficient.  The system is also open to error
    from manual transcription into other administration systems, and at risk
    of loss, damage or misuse.

    The EOM project addresses these issues by reducing, simplifying, and
    automating a number of steps in handling and processing of the court
    record.  This will improve and better control access to official court
    records regardless of location, and reduce the risk of misuse or loss of
    information.  Having a single authoritative record will also increase
    the quality of information available to justice agencies.

  <a href="http://www.justice.govt.nz/publications/global-publications/b/briefings-to-incoming-ministers-2011/documents/VOTE%20COURTS%202011%20BIM%20FOR%20RELEASE.pdf">http://www.justice.govt.nz/publications/global-publications/b/briefings-to-incoming-ministers-2011/documents/VOTE%20COURTS%202011%20BIM%20FOR%20RELEASE.pdf</a>

The concern to reduce error is praiseworthy.

Phase 1 was supposed to begin operation in March this year.

However,

    From 1 July 2013, implementation of the justice sector's Electronic
    Operating Model will begin with the electronic filing of Police charges.
    We asked why the implementation of the electronic filing of judicial
    decisions has been delayed until 2014.  We heard that an audit of the
    Ministry of Justice project found the programming to be more complicated
    than expected.  Some processes have already been tested, but real-time
    live trials of the system will also be conducted before the progressive
    implementation at courts next year.  The technology will reduce the time
    involved in handling documents and make them more easily accessible.  We
    will follow the implementation of the Electronic Operating Model
    closely. —Extracted from <a href="http://www.parliament.nz/resource/0001682426">http://www.parliament.nz/resource/0001682426</a>

The system is now being described as costing "$30 million".

From an article printed on page 6 of the Friday July 26 issue of *The Otago
Daily Times*, reprinted from *The New Zealand Herald*:

  - The project was flagged at risk and getting worse in November 2012
  - "the project was reporting that these technical matters would be
    sorted out"
  - Staff "were compelled to work evenings and weekends"
  - under "three extraordinarily high work streams"
  - resulting in "key resignations amid prolonged work periods",
    also described as "a wave of resignations"
  - During all this high pressure, "staff were moved to a
    different floor of the national headquarters, which had seating
    for only 45 of the 48 staff, and more were hired".

Sounds to me like some manager at the Ministry of Justice (possibly
Crazy Eddie from the Mote) had never read 1 Kings 12.

The thing is that on the 3rd of October last year,
it was announced that
    31 jobs would be lost at 13 courts
    4 courts would be closed
    9 would have their hours slashed
    2 of those 9 would be reconsidered for closure in 2013
    and "two tiers of management [would] have to reapply".
    a net reduction of 68 staff

The changes duly took place this year, in anticipation of the
benefits of the new system...

I wonder if any of the decision-makers had heard of "counting your
chickens before they're hatched"?

I did an experiment on my Windows 7 machine yesterday.

I right-clicked on the wireless connection in my system tray to Open Network
and Sharing Center.

I then clicked on Access type: Internet Connections: Wireless Network
Connection in order to get the Wireless Connection Status panel to display
(it's much easier to do this in Windows XP).

This Wireless Connection Status panel displays the number of bytes sent &amp;
received on the wireless connection since the last time it was reset.

(This wireless connection is the only connection this particular computer
has with the outside world.)

I then turned off every background task on this machine that I could find
that didn't seem relevant to simply running my local Windows machine.

I then left the machine alone for several hours.

Even though the machine is doing *nothing* (no browser, no e-mail, no file
server, no music serving, etc.), there is still some residual amount of
network traffic that runs to megabytes over several hours.

Interestingly, there was almost 3x the traffic being *sent* as being
*received*.

I then tried the same experiment with my Windows XP machine.  Simply
right-click on the wireless icon in the system tray and click on 'status'.

The result: much less traffic—essentially zero.

Perhaps someone on this list has an explanation for this phenomenon.

FYI—What could possibly go wrong here?

Is Your Cable Box Spying On You?  Behavior-Detecting Devices From Verizon, Microsoft And Others Worry Privacy Advocates
<a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/your-cable-box-spying-you-behavior-detecting-devices-verizon-microsoft-others-worry-privacy-1361587">http://www.ibtimes.com/your-cable-box-spying-you-behavior-detecting-devices-verizon-microsoft-others-worry-privacy-1361587</a>

Pay-TV providers like Verizon and tech giants like Microsoft are developing
devices that can monitor our behaviors as we watch TV and play games.
Reuters

“Watching the watchers'' is taking on a whole new meaning.

News that Google Inc. may be developing a television set-top box with a
motion sensor and video camera has rekindled the debate over technology that
can record so-called ambient action. Should a TV-mounted box have the
ability to track our movements, record our voices and monitor our behaviors?
Should cable providers and tech companies be allowed to collect such
information without our consent?

Lawmakers and privacy advocates are asking such questions as companies
continue to experiment with data collection that will extend beyond our
gadgets and into our living rooms and bedrooms. On Thursday, the Wall Street
Journal reported that Google privately showed off a prototype device at the
Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last January. The company is one of
many tech players looking to compete with pay-TV providers, who themselves
have been exploring new ways to capture information about viewers' behavior.

In November, Verizon Communications Inc. filed a patent application for a
set-top box that delivers advertisements based on users' behaviors.  For
instance, two people cuddling on sofa watching TV might see a commercial for
a romantic Disney cruise, while an arguing couple might see a pitch for
couples' therapy. The device would use a combination of motion and audio
sensors to collect information about what viewers are doing as they watch
TV.

Creeped out yet? You're not alone. News of Verizon's plans brought countless
headlines about the potential for Orwellian cable boxes and digital video
recorders, spying on us during our most intimate moments. And legislators
have been quick to respond. Last month, two U.S. congressmen, a Democrat and
a Republican, introduced a bill that would require such devices to be
opt-in, meaning consumers would have to grant explicit consent before
companies could collect data on ambient action. The bill—dubbed the We
Are Watching You Act of 2013—would also require that devices flash
on-screen warnings whenever they are recording such information.

Reps. Michael E. Capuano, D-Mass., and Walter Jones, R-N.C., who sponsored
the bill, called such technology an “invasion of privacy.'' In a statement,
Jones even acknowledged the data collected through such devices could be
potentially abused by the government itself. “When the government has an
unfortunate history of secretly collecting private citizens' information
from technology providers, we must ensure that safeguards are in place to
protect Americans' rights,'' he said.

The extent to which Google's set-top box would collect ambient information
is unclear. In its report, the Journal cited only “people briefed on the
device,'' and a Google representative has not yet responded to a request for
more information. However, the company has reportedly been experimenting
with such technology for several years. As Gizmodo reported in 2007, Google
filed for a patent for an interactive TV that would include an image-capture
device capable of measuring “how many viewers are watching or listening to
a broadcast.''

And Google and Verizon are by no means lone players. In November, the
Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) also filed a patent application for a system
that would use its Kinect camera to monitor users' behavior. Kinect will
come attached to Microsoft's forthcoming Xbox One game consoles. Its
always-on sensors can read body behavior, track eye movements and listen for
commands. It even knows how many people are in the room. As Polygon
reported, the device has raised numerous concerns among privacy advocates,
particularly in light of Microsoft's reported compliance with the National
Security Agency's PRISM program.

If it makes you feel any better, Microsoft has vowed to “aggressively
challenge'' any government attempt to spy on its customers using Kinect
sensors. “Absent a new law, we don't believe the government has the legal
authority to compel us or any other company that makes products with cameras
and microphones to start collecting voice and video data,'' a company
representative told the Verge this month.

If that doesn't allay your fears, you can visit Microsoft's Xbox One privacy
page.

If you have a rooted Android device, I recommend against rushing to install
Android 4.3 for now. It appears that 4.3's new protection model may require
re-rooting devices in various situations (and require a new, rather kludgy
workaround, for now at least), and unless you have some reason to push
through 4.3 quickly (which is a relatively minor update in most other
respects) I would suggest holding off until best practice procedures have
been developed and promulgated. If you don't root your devices, you won't
care about this, and you can jump to 4.3 immediately and happily.
