<i>Mon, 22 Apr 96 17:37:54 +0200</i>
<pre>
We have found a privacy/security bug in the Java implementation of the
Netscape Navigator. It is very easily possible for an applet to find out the
pathname of the directory in which the Netscape Navigator was started.  This
information could then be sent back to a CGI program for logging. Clearly
this information should not be available to an applet, as is indicated by
the fact that applets are prevented from reading the "user.home" and
"user.dir" system properties.

When the Netscape Navigator is run under the Windows 95 OS, the pathname
usually does not contain any critical information. However, when the
Navigator is run under a multi-user network OS, such as UNIX, the pathname
often contains the e-mail and/or login name of the user. In addition, the
pathname might reveal details about the topology of the user's network,
which an experienced hacker might be able to exploit.

There are two ways to protect yourself from this problem: Either start up
the Netscape Navigator in a directory whose pathname does not reveal any
critical information, or disable Java altogether (Options | Security
Preferences | General). A system administrator can protect his network by
configuring the HTTP proxy server not to retrieve Java ".class" files.

This bug is present in at least the following versions of the Navigator:

        2.0
        2.01
        3.0b2
        2.0GoldB1
        2.01Gold

and in the implementations for at least the following platforms:

        SunOS 4.1.2, 4.1.3, 4.1.4
        SunOS 5.3, 5.4, 5.5
        Windows 95, Windows NT
        IRIX 5.2, 5.3
        HP-UX A.0903, A.0905
        Linux 1.2.10, 1.2.13
        FreeBSD 2.1.0-RELEASE
        OSF1 V3.2

We have not tested whether this bug also exists in Sun's HotJava browser.

We will release full details of the bug as soon as Sun and Netscape have
issued patches which fix the problem.

Full details have been sent to Sun and Netscape. This announcements has also
been posted to the "comp.lang.java" newsgroup and has been sent to CERT.

It is well known that numerous computer programs are so poorly designed and
implemented that they cannot handle special cases of people's names (e.g.,
the case of the person simply named "Smith", as in <a href="/Risks/18/05">RISKS-18.05</a>).  In some
other cases, there are real physical (and other) constraints that are hard
to code around, such as in the case of some colleagues whose long names risk
falling off the edge of their company badges.

Sometimes people just push things to far to the extreme.  The Guardian
Weekly reported (in the issue ending 21 Apr 1996, p.4) that "a Swedish court
has fined a couple $660 for breaking the law by naming their son
Brfxxxcccxxmnnpcccclllmmnprxxvvclmnckssqlbb11116--or Albin for short."

Does anyone know what law was broken, and can anyone decode the meaning or
origin, if any, of this choice of name?

  This is clearly job for a new Sesame Street song to help

<i>Fri, 19 Apr 1996 17:22:03 -0400</i>
<pre>
Baltimore just finished creating a brand new technologically advanced
"central booking" building where police take people after they've been
arrested. Unfortunately, this heavily computerized system has become media
fodder lately as people get lost in the building and are not released for
days. I've seen one television news report that interviewed a woman who said
she spent five days in the building because of a minor warrant for an unpaid
fine. Bail was posted several times and lost.

The Thursday 18 Apr 1996 edition of the *Baltimore Sun* reports that the
system is now working faster after the police started overriding the
computers. For instance, there was an automated system by which prisoners
could be called up for their hearings.  The handheld computers that carried
these messages, however, didn't work and now the City has detailed five
extra officers to escort the prisoners instead.

Another woman complained that her 18-year-old retarded child was held a full
day after bail was set. She says that she was speaking with booking center
over the telephone when the child knocked at the door. The booking center
was telling her that her son could *not* be released until all of the
computer records were complete. I can only hope that the same glitch won't
let out a dangerous criminal.

The article ends by noting that the District Court Commissioner says that
"Anybody [who's] been in this building would be a damn fool to [go] back to
it."

<i>Fri, 19 Apr 96 14:28:31 CDT</i>
<pre>
I would like to bring your attention to some recent joint work by Advanced
Micro Devices, Inc., and Computational Logic, Inc., in which the ACL2
theorem prover was used to prove the correctness of an algorithm of
commercial interest.  In particular we proved the correctness of the kernel
of the floating-point division algorithm on the AMD5K86, the first
Pentium-class processor produced by AMD.  Roughly speaking, we proved that
the algorithm implements division on the double extended precision normal
and denormal numbers of the IEEE standard, in the sense that (under
appropriate hypotheses) it returns the floating-point number obtained by
rounding the ``infinitely precise'' quotient by the method and to the
precision specified by a given rounding mode.  The permitted rounding modes
include round to 0, round away from 0, round to nearest, round to positive
(or negative) infinity, and ``sticky'' rounding.  The proof is quite
interesting, involving as it does the formalization of a lot of
floating-point ``folklore'' and classical numerical analysis.

         A Mechanically Checked Proof of the Correctness of the Kernel
             of the AMD5K86 (tm) Floating-point Division Algorithm

ABSTRACT:

We describe a mechanically checked proof of the correctness of the kernel of
the floating-point division algorithm used on the AMD5K86 microprocessor.
The kernel is a non-restoring division algorithm that computes the
floating-point quotient of two double extended precision floating-point
numbers, p and d (d \= 0), with respect to a rounding mode, mode.  The
algorithm is defined in terms of floating-point addition and multiplication.
First, two Newton-Raphson iterations are used to compute a floating-point
approximation of the reciprocal of d.  The result is used to compute four
floating-point quotient digits in the 24,,17 format (24 bits of precision
and 17 bit exponents) which are then summed using appropriate rounding
modes.  We prove that if p and d are 64,,15 (possibly denormal)
floating-point numbers, d \= 0 and mode specifies one of six rounding
procedures and a desired precision 0 &lt; n &lt;= 64, then the output of the
algorithm is p/d rounded according to mode.  We prove that every
intermediate result is a floating-point number in the format required by the
resources allocated to it.  Our claims have been mechanically checked using
the ACL2 theorem prover.

<i>19 Apr 1996 21:07:06 GMT</i>
<pre>
Taking advantage of yet another incentive offer, I recently switched my long
distance carrier to MCI. They sent me the standard
yet-another-piece-of-plastic-to-stick-in-my-wallet calling cards. The way
these cards work is that you call an 1-800 number and type in your code
consisting of your phone number followed by your PIN (Personal
Identification Number) which happens to be printed on the card.

Enclosed with the cards was a piece of paper in which MCI wisely suggests
that you change your PIN to something other than what they assigned to you
and printed on the card:

  Customizing your PIN

  Choosing your own four-digit number is the best way to assure you'll
  never forget your PIN. Make it the month and year of a loved one's
  birthday or use the same password you have for your voice mail or
  computer. We'll quickly replace the PIN we assigned you with any four
  digits you choose - just call 1-800-476-7306

For some strange reason MCI is recommending you to do exactly the opposite
of what good security practices would proscribe! Not only do they suggest
that you use an easily-breakable password such as an important date, but
they recommend a practice that would weaken the security of potentially more
sensitive information in a voice-mail or computer system.

Of course, what probably prompted note from MCI was a desire to prevent
MCI's customer service department from being inundated with calls from
people who forgot their PINs. This alludes to the associated risk of
requiring people to remember Yet Another Password (YAP).

I find it necessary every few weeks to set the clock on my Unix box at home
because PCs are not generally known for incorporating accurate timekeeping
hardware.  Shortly before doing this recently, I ran across this notice on
the web page of the US Naval Observatory Directorate of Time, operates a
number of stratum-1 NTP servers, and is otherwise the official source of
time in the United States.

 <a href="http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/phonecheck.html">http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/phonecheck.html</a>

 On the morning of April 16, the Directorate of Time moved its
 Master Clock #1 Hydrogen Maser to a new environmental chamber in
 Washington, D.C. Timing operations were switched to Master Clock #2
 Hydrogen Maser. All except our network time servers tick and tock,
 which failed to switch over, and jumped back 744.126 seconds
 between 12:32:58 UT and 14:23:46 UT, when the problem was corrected.

 This jump was 10 million times the normal precision of these systems.

Presumably, other stratum 1 NTP servers operating from local clocks, WWV or
GPS broadcasts successfully made both changeovers and never noticed.  Many
protocols, kerberos for instance, would not take kindly to a ten-minute
drift.  While the close coupling of hosts "tick" and "tock" to the actual US
time standard make them appealing servers as far as nerdly bragging rights
are concerned, in this instance it also made them vulnerable to the
_process_ by which US time is determined.

<i>Tue, 23 Apr 96 20:26:16 +0400</i>
<pre>
I have found a serious bug (feature?) in Windows 95. It does not properly
treat files that contain certain characters in their names.  These
characters include those with ASCII values of 255, 254, 249, 244, 23* and
some others, all above 127. I have not found a common rule (so I probably
failed the Microsoft IQ test :).

This problem was noted by Olcay Cirit in <a href="/Risks/17/64">RISKS-17.64</a> in regards to ASCII
229.  He wrote that if this character is the first in a filename, then the
file cannot be deleted, copied, renamed or executed.  Actually, *any* of
these characters at *any* place in the filename will spoil the file.  Such
files are visible in Explorer, with bad characters shown as underscores.
You can create shortcuts to them, view their properties or even try to
rename them.  But any serious operation has to be performed from the command
line.

A pecularity of my DOS file managing program is that it uses direct disk
access to delete files.  I could not do that under Windows 95 until
recently, so to deal with the "bad characters" I had to reboot into DOS
prompt.  Then I discovered the the "LOCK" command will allow DOS utilities
to access disk directly.  However, this is probably an undocumented command,
it's absent in the DOS help file, and it is not an executable file.

A note for those unfamiliar with the "funny" characters.  You can enter any
character at the DOS prompt by holding the Alt key and pressing the keys
with digits for the character at the numeric keypad.  For example, Alt+097
is 'a', and Alt+255 is one of the "bad characters".  So, to see the
described behaviour for yourself, create at the DOS prompt a new file that
has a "bad character" in its name, then try to do something with it in
Windows 95.

The RISKS? Aside from user confusion and possible pranks (which cannot do
much harm, because you can always go to the command line and fix the
things), there is another issue.  Usually filenames with "bad characters"
are not used.  However, here in Russia one way of russifying a PC is to
replace all those Greek, German and Swedish symbols that reside in the upper
part of the ASCII table with Russian letters.  So, if a Russian user had
many files with Russian names, and then switched to Windows 95... Surprise,
surprise!  You can't manage your old files there.

I have to confess that I do not know how Russian edition of Windows 95
works. I am using the US edition.

Bell Atlantic NYNEX Mobile has a web page at: <a href="http://www.banm.com">http://www.banm.com</a>

&gt;From that web page I got an e-mail address (ny@bam.com) and sent a report
 of a service difficulty.

I also identified my account and the dealer from which I signed up for
service.

Fortunately I did NOT post my PIN number in the message.

The dealer then called me to say that my message had gone "all over the
internet"!

I then e-mailed BANM again asking:
     "Do private e-mail messages such as this wind up being spread all over
     the internet by your site?

     I was not aware of this. Why don't you warn people sending you e-mail
     messages that this happens.

     I would assume that some of your customers would feel that this is an
     invasion of privacy and possibly litigatable.

BELL ATLANTIC NYNEX MOBILE has not replied yet.

I think that this should be a warning to people sending BANM what they THINK
to be private e-mail messages to be advised that they may wind being
published on their web page. So be sure not to put confidential information
in messages to BANM.

&gt;Anatoly Voronov, the director of Glasnet, an Internet service provider in
&gt;Russia, says:  "It is just incredible when I hear people talking about how
&gt;open the Web is.  It is the ultimate act of intellectual colonialism.  The
&gt;product comes from America so we either must adapt to English or stop using
&gt;it.  ...

Sigh.  As always clueless get most publicity.

Apparently Mr. Director of small but noisy local service provider is not
aware that Russia-language newsgroup traffic is second to English-language.
Apparently he's not aware that domestic ISPs in Russia offer quite a lot of
Russian-language material.  Apparently he does not even realize that
understanding of Internet technology in Russia is good enough that there
happened to be quite a few recent Russian immigrants taking senior positions
in U.S. telecom industry.

The prevalence of English is merely due to the need for some common
language.  A modern man cannot be considered educated if he cannot read it.
It's like Latin centuries ago.

How can anybody's head to be so screwed as to consider the only real advance
in destroying the inter-cultural communication barriers to be "the ultimate
act of intellectual colonialism" (ain't that an oxymoron?) is beyond my
comprehension.

Maybe French government should send him a job offer.

1) Nicholas (sp?) Negroponte of MIT's Media Lab begins his book
   "Being Digital" by emphasizing the difference between transporting
   bits and transporting atoms.  The Internet moves bits.  The Soviet
   Union, in its heyday of real rather than intellectual colonialism,
   moved atoms, i.e., people, in very large numbers, specifically natives
   out of subordinated lands, Russians into them.

I think one of the most frightening aspects of this was the penultimate
screen image.  There is an option "YES" (i.e., proceed) but none for "NO"
(i.e., I've changed my mind).

OK, the very last screen _does_ give you this choice, but ... how is the
intended patient to know that there's another screen coming up (unless they
go through a dress rehearsal)???  That screen yelled out at me from the
(I think it was last Tuesday's Australian newspaper but could have been
the Sun's) Computer Section page.

There was no obvious way to change one's mind.

This is the ultimate bad GUI design - no apparent option to cancel or go for
a "none of the above" decision.  Stupidity?  Criminal?  I don't know, but it
was downright frightening.

It reminds me of (and I don't mean to belittle the thread) dialog boxes
(or alerts) which used to notify you of a (serious) System Error on the Mac.
It gave you the "choice" of doing a restart (reboot) or a quit.  The trouble
was that the quit almost always never worked and the thing froze anyway.
Current Mac SW gives you the "choice" of restarting only (apart from those
that automatically quit to the Finder).

Perhaps the subtle differences between an Alert

    Where you usually don't have a choice - e.g., "You are about to
    die.. Press OK to continue"

and all other forms of dialog boxes

    Where you _do_ have a choice (and even an escape hatch not covered
    by those being solicited)..

need to be made more obvious.  The ornamentation (at least on the Mac) for both
types of displays (windows) are very similar.  The windows in question
(from memory) actually seemed more like web browser pages  with the YES/NO
options as links.

As for an escape hatch, there should always be one, regardless.  It should
never be out of view (ie, it should *never* be scrolled off the top).

Say, for example, a patient had a change of heart with that penultimate
window displayed.  OK, there's always the "quit" menu option, hitting the
power switch, etc, but how comfortable and certain is he/she that this
hasn't left the drip (or whatever) still in a primed state?  There is no
confirmation that equipment has been de-activated, especially if he/she hits
the power/restart switch.

Critical systems indeed.

In: Risks-Forum Digest  Friday 19 April 1996  Volume 18 : Issue 05

&gt;From: Edupage Editors &lt;educom@elanor.oit.unc.edu&gt;
&gt;Subject: More Microsoft Viruses (Edupage, 16 Apr 1996)
&gt;First there was the Word virus — now there's a Word Prank Macro Virus,

Before Microsoft admitted it *was* a virus, their term for WordMacro.Concept
(the "original"), was the Word Prank Macro.  This isn't new at all.

&gt;located in a document on ActiveVRML, Microsoft's software tool for
&gt;developing 3-D Web sites.  But what's worse, is that Microsoft had to inform
&gt;the programmers who attended its Professional Developers Conference last
&gt;month that one of the CD-ROMs it distributed was infected.  A cure is posted

Concept is everywhere.  Of those who work in large corporations, the only
ones who *don't* regale me with stories of massive infestations are those
who do not know how to check for it.  Microsoft has been a repeat offender:
we are constantly hearing of new disks and CD-ROMs from MS that contain
infected documents.

&gt;on Microsoft's Web site &lt; <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">http://www.microsoft.com/</a> &gt;  (*Investor's Business
&gt;Daily*, 15 Apr 1996, A8)

Microsoft's anti-WordMacro/Prank/Concept package is a Word macro itself.  It
takes a piecemeal approach, and has been updated several times as new macro
viruses have been discovered.  The protection provided has holes: it is best
not to rely on it.

Edupage has had a large number of erroneous virus reports over the past year.
No worse than the general press, of course (where their material is obtained),
but somewhat disturbing in the technical community they distribute to.

<i>Fri, 19 Apr 96 16:03 EST</i>

     I have spoken to several people who have signed up for the new
toll-free US 888 numbers (addition to the older 800 numbers).  They are
seeing a precursor to the year 2000 problem - many systems don't recognize
888 numbers.
     One story was told that a sales person called his 888 numbered voice
mail system from his hotel room.  When he went to check out, he had a bill
for over $60 in phone charges.  It seems that the local hotel did not
recognize the prefix 888, and so assumed it was a long distance call and
charged the highest toll rates.  Other stories tell of pay phones that will
not accept calls using 888, car phones that reject calls dialed with 888, as
well as a myriad of other system related glitches.
     The change seems simple - just tell your system that 888 is a valid
toll free prefix.  However, as with the Y2K problem, it seems that plenty of
systems either were not ready for the change, or are incapable of accepting
it.  If this is any indication of the Y2K RISK, I'm moving to a remote
mountain top in 1999.
