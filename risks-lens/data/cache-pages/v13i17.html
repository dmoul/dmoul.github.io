REPORTEDLY A LEGISLATIVE "FIRST"
   This effort in "electronic democracy" may be the first time that state
legislation has been distributed online, for access by the general public,
at the same time it becomes available to legislators and their staff.
   A senior member of the Senate computer system's technical staff reportedly
said they have never-before down-loaded a machine-readable copy of initial
legislation onto a personal computer for redistribution on public computer
networks.
  Furthermore, Sen. Lockyer's Legislative Assistant responsible for the bill
said he knows of no prior instance where legislative staff have gone online
on public nets to seek citizen input and discussion about new legislation.

SOURCES OF ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS &amp; INFORMATION
   Mr. Ben Firschein is the Legislative Assistant to Sen. Lockyer who is
handling this bill:
      Office of Senator Bill Lockyer
      Room 2032, State Capitol
      Sacramento CA 95814
      Mr. Firschein/916-445-6671, main number/916-445-5957, email/**
   Formatted, binary, machine-readable versions of this text will be
available on the WELL, the Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link.  The WELL is a public
teleconferencing system located in Sausalito, California, accessible via the
Internet; voice/415-332-4335, 2400-baud data/7-E-1/415-332-6106.  For read-
only access instructions, SEND A REQUEST TO:  jwarren@well.sf.ca.us.
** — Mr. Firschein will be online on the WELL within a week or so.  You may
request his email address, also, from  jwarren@well.sf.ca.us.
There will be four read-only files:
   A.  The original file that was down-loaded from the Senate's legislative
computer system in WordPerfect format on a PC-compatible diskette.
   B.  The above file, converted to a Word-5.0 Macintosh format, with
pagination approximating the printed copies of the bill available from the
legislative offices.
   C.  Background information, explanations and mention of some alternatives,
prepared by Mr. Firschein, in original WordPerfect format for PC-compatibles.
   D.  That backgrounder file, converted to Word-5.0 Macintosh format.

REPRESENTING LEGISLATION-IN-PROGRESS: A NOTATION PROBLEM
   In the California Senate, printed legislation-in-progress uses the
following conventions:
  When stating new legislation, *plain-text* states PROPOSED law.
  When *amending* current law, *plain-text* states the CURRENT law, and
*strike-thru text* indicates current law to be deleted while *underscored* or
*italicized* text represents wording to be added to those current statutes.
Deletions and additions represented by strike-thru and underlining or italics
*amend* current law.
  But, the basic ASCII character-set — and a great many older terminals and
computer printers — have no strike-thru, italics or underlining.  So, here
is how that unavailable notation is represented in this document:
    [[ annotation ]] — explanatory comments by "uploader" Jim Warren
       all capitals  — originally bold-face text; no legislative meaning
  Unless stated as amending current law:
       plain-text    — text of new legislation, proposed to be new law
  When stated as amending current law:
       plain-text    — text of current law to remain unchanged
    &lt;&lt; strikethru &lt;&gt; — text in current law, proposed for deletion
    {{ underscore }} — text proposed to be added to current law.

THE BEGINNING ...
  The introduction of this legislation in the Senate is the beginning of
a lengthy process or review and revision by amendment, prior to its possible
passage into law.
  Please send your comments and suggestions about the legislation — and
about the Senate staff's active cooperation in making it publicly available,
online — to Mr. Firschein and Sen. Lockyer.

  SEC. 5. Section 27565 of the Streets and Highways Code is amended to read:
[[** NOTE: This is another amendment, with strikethrus and underscores. **]]
   27565.  (a) The Department of Transportation, in cooperation with the
district and all known entities planning to implement a toll facility in this
state, shall develop and adopt functional specifications and standards for an
automatic vehicle identification system, in compliance with the following
objectives:
   (1) In order to be detected, the driver shall not be required to reduce
speed below the applicable speed for the type of facility being used.
   (2) The vehicle owner shall not be required to purchase or install more
than one device to use on all toll facilities, but may be required to have a
separate account or financial arrangement for the use of these facilities.
   (3) The facility operators shall have the ability to select from different
manufacturers and vendors.   The specifications and standards shall encourage
multiple bidders, and shall not have the effect of limiting the facility
operators to choosing a system which is able to be supplied by only one
manufacturer or vendor.
   (b) {{ The vehicle owner shall have the choice of prepaying tolls, or
being billed after using the facility.  If the vehicle owner prepays tolls:
   (1) The department or any privately owned entity operating a toll facility
shall issue an account number to the vehicle owner. The account number shall
not be derived from the vehicle owner's name, address, social security
number, or driver's license number, or the vehicle's license number, vehicle
identification number, or registration.
   (2) Once an account has been established and an account number has been
given to the vehicle owner, neither the department nor the privately owned
facility shall keep any record of the vehicle owner's name, address, social
security number, or driver's license number, or the vehicle's license number,
vehicle identification number, or registration.
   (3) The vehicle owner may make additional prepayments by specifying the
account number and furnishing payment. }}
   {{ (c) }} Any automatic vehicle identification system purchased or
installed after January 1, 1991, shall comply with the specifications and
standards adopted pursuant to subdivision (a).
   {{ (d) Any automatic vehicle identification system purchased or installed
after January 1, 1993, shall comply with the specifications and standards
adopted pursuant to subdivisions (a) and (b). }}
