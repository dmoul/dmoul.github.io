<address>Jeremy Epstein &lt;jepstein@monumental.com&gt;</address>
<i>Tue, 1 Feb 2000 09:40:14 -0500 (EST)</i>
<p>An article in *The New York Times* 1 Feb 2000 details former CIA Director Deutch's use of unclassified Macintosh computers in his homes to store thousands of highly classified documents on the same computer he used to access AOL, Citibank's personal
banking service, and other services. The investigation seems to have been delayed and perhaps limited as a result of Deutch's position.</p>
<p>It's old hat that personal computers (be they Windows, Macintosh, or UNIX-based) are inherently unsuitable for Multi-Level Security (MLS). What we see here is that even though all the proper procedures were in place, the human element is sufficient to
undermine all of the technical controls. As long as we have people, we'll have RISKS!</p>
<p>Full article at <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/yr/mo/day/news/washpol/cia-impeach-deutch.html">http://www.nytimes.com/yr/mo/day/news/washpol/cia-impeach-deutch.html</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>[Multilevel security may not seem to be an issue here *internally* because John Deutch had access to all of the information on his systems, considered as SYSTEM HIGH — that is all logically at the highest level. However, surfing the (unclassified)
Web is clearly a NO-NO from such a machine. RISKS readers are of course familiar with the risks of Web browsing. However, an added note in this case was the report that the visited sites included a porn site. Deutch apparently denied having accessed porn
any sites, suggesting that it might have been done by one of his offspring? If that is indeed true, it would make the presence of highly classified information on a multiuser workstation even more untenable. (On one hand, even if such a PC claimed to be
multilevel secure, that would be a VERY BAD misuse. On the other hand, RISKS readers know how one can be duped into visiting sites other than what was expected, as in clicking on whitehouse.com instead of whitehouse.gov, or in clicking on a Trojan-horsed
URL.) PGN]</dd>

Systems Affected
     * Web browsers
     * Web servers that dynamically generate pages based on unvalidated
       input

Overview
   A web site may inadvertently include malicious HTML tags or script in
   a dynamically generated page based on unvalidated input from
   untrustworthy sources. This can be a problem when a web server does
   not adequately ensure that generated pages are properly encoded to
   prevent unintended execution of scripts, and when input is not
   validated to prevent malicious HTML from being presented to the user.

   [This is referred to as "cross-site scripting".  Note that
   executables in the URL itself can have nasty effects.  PGN]

For almost the entire work week of 24 Jan 2000, failures of NSA computers
caused an information blackout for intercepted messages.  The failure was
blamed by one report on a ``system overload'', by another report on a
software problem.  [Sources: NSA System Inoperative for Four Days,

<address>David Shaw &lt;David.Shaw@alcatel.com.au&gt;</address>
<i>Fri, 4 Feb 2000 11:54:27 +1100</i>
<p>On Wednesday, February 2, 2000, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) formally announced an increase in the official interest rates of 0.5%.</p>
<p>The formal announcement was made at 09:30. However, in what turned out to be an embarrassing mistake for the RBA, 64 people were sent an e-mail at 09:24 (i.e., 6 minutes early) advising them of the rate increase. This was quite remarkable in itself, as
the RBA has a near-legendary record of security.</p>
<p>The information proved to be very valuable for two reasons. Not only was the information available early to a very small segment of the market, the size of the rate increase was unexpected. Virtually the entire market had been expecting/predicting an
increase of just 0.25%.</p>
<p>In the 6 minutes prior to 09:30, approximately AUD$3 billion worth of bill and bond futures were dumped on the market.</p>
<p>The record of trades at the Sydney Futures Exchange demonstrates the selling frenzy. When interest rates last rose, on November 3, 1999, 336 three-year bond futures contracts and 324 90-day bank bill futures were traded between 09:25 and 09:30. The
corresponding trades preceding yesterday's announcement were 2,739 and 2,811.</p>
<p>To quote an unnamed trader: "Some people made a lot of money in those few minutes."</p>

<address>"Peter B. Ladkin" &lt;ladkin@rvs.uni-bielefeld.de&gt;</address>
<i>Wed, 02 Feb 2000 11:07:21 +0100</i>
<p>Flight data displays such as airspeed and attitude indicators as well as navigation displays on modern commercial aircraft are nowadays electronic, replacing mechanical displays that were common until 10-15 years ago. Mechanical displays are often used
as backup, although there are electronic backup displays available on the market. Mechanical displays were/are not susceptible to total outage. Airspeed indicators are basically differential barometers, and mechanical attitude indicators are
gyroscopes.</p>
<p>According to Flight International's David Learmount (01-07.02.2000, p12), Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS) failure is the "main possibility" being looked at by the Swiss accident investigation people (BEAA) in the crash of the Crossair Saab
340B just after takeoff from Zuerich on 10 January. This was Crossair's first accident. I emphasise that the causes of the accident have not been established. It is hoped that the non-volatile memory on the EFIS displays can be recovered and read, to
determine how what the pilots were seeing corresponds (or not!) with the flight profile recorded by the flight data recorder. (This is a benefit not provided by mechanical displays, although it would hardly make up for the susceptibility of EFIS to
outages!)</p>
<p>EFIS failures have been noted in particular in incidents involving a Virgin A340 and a Martinair B767 (see the compendium Computer-Related Incidents With Commercial Aircraft on my WWW site). A Formosa Airlines Saab 340B descended into the ocean on 18
March 1998, and it has been rumored that one EFIS display was known before the flight not to be functioning.</p>

<p>*Flight International*, 11-17 Jan 2000, p29, reports that NASA has fixed "computer and antenna faults" on the Terra spacecraft, launched 18 Dec 1999. Terra is part of the Earth Observing System. "The main computer shut down shortly after launch because
of a bug in the navigation software, according to NASA." The failure occurred a minute before the winter solstice, while the sun's position in the nav software was being updated.</p>
<p>On the other side of things, the antenna "was repaired by alterations to the software", at which one can only marvel. Maybe Uri Geller is now programming for a living. Or maybe they meant the problem was worked around.</p>

Friedman. "It is electronic stalking. It violates the eavesdropping statutes, and from a civil aspect it's an invasion of privacy." Friedman says he plans to file a class-action lawsuit against the company. Meanwhile, DoubleClick was sued last week by a
California woman who claims the online ad company illegally collected and sold her personal and demographic data. [ZDNet/MSNBC 28 Jan 2000) <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/363455.asp">http://www.msnbc.com/news/363455.asp</a>; NewsScan Daily, 31 Jan

<i>Tue, 25 Jan 2000 08:18:19 -0700</i>
<p>[On 31 Jan 2000] China's government plans to institute a rule requiring foreign firms in China to disclose what type of software they use for encrypting their electronic messages. Eventually, the companies must divulge details about employees using the
software, making it easier for authorities to monitor personal and commercial Internet use. The new rules also bar Chinese companies from buying products containing foreign-designed encryption software, a move that could stymie the growth of Internet use
in that country. Diplomatic missions are exempted, but the regulations cover the routers and servers that make up the backbone of China's networks, most of which came from foreign companies. "If IBM or Hewlett-Packard wants to sell an e-commerce Web
server to China, it might have to isolate which parts relate to security" and find a Chinese company to write the software, says the director of the U.S. Information Technology Office's Beijing branch. "I don't think Chinese companies have that ability."

<p>In a study conducted for the California HealthCare Foundation, the Georgetown University's Health Privacy Project has found that drkoop.com, webmd.com, ivillage.com, yahoo.com, onhealth.com, and other Web sites that provide information on health
matters are cavalier about privacy practices: "The privacy policies of health Web sites do not match up with their own practices." Example: some companies share e-mail addresses and other visitor data even though their Web sites promised they would do no
such thing. The companies are disputing the study findings. [Reuters/*San Jose Mercury News* 1 Feb 2000, <a href="http://www.sjmercury.com/svtech/news/breaking/internet/docs/160309l.htm">http://www.sjmercury.com/svtech/news/breaking/internet/docs/160309l.htm</a>; NewsScan Daily, 2 Feb 2000]</p>

<address>Jason Axley &lt;jason.axley@attws.com&gt;</address>
<i>Tue, 1 Feb 2000 10:05:34 -0800 (PST)</i>
<p>The recent threads about information hiding in MS Outlook are quite timely as I've just recently discovered an interesting information hiding "feature" of MS Outlook.</p>
<p>I received an e-mail from an MS Outlook user that was transmitted to me via SMTP. The e-mail was in MIME multipart/alternative format and, as such, had two attachments: a plain text version of the e-mail content and another attachment with the exact
same message in HTML format. Outlook has settings that let users control which format they sent Internet users e-mail in and this user has Outlook configured to send both versions (I believe that this is the default setting when sending to non-Exchange
addresses).</p>
<p>I replied to this individual using Pine but then this individual responded saying that my message was received, but that there wasn't any additional text in it. I thought this strange as I can see in my sent-mail that I did reply with additional text.
So, I sent the message again and again was told that there wasn't any text in the message.</p>
<p>It turns out that what was happening was that I had modified the plain text version of the multipart/alternative MIME message (which is the one that Pine opens as the actual message), but that when Pine sent the reply, it included the HTML
"alternative" version as an attachment as well (although this was an alternative for the *original* message) Outlook then ignores the modified plain text version because it thinks that the attached HTML version is the same message, just in HTML. So, the
recipient was seeing the original HTML message that I hadn't modified and was not able to see the plan text version. Outlook doesn't even list the plaintext version as an attachment so Outlook users cannot access the information there even if they wanted
to!</p>
<p>Ironically, the text that Exchange or Outlook puts in the message header for non-MIME-compliant MUAs says "This message is in MIME format. Since your mail reader does not understand this format, some or all of this message may not be legible."</p>

(Was: Lessons of Y2K, Toby Gottfried, <a href="/Risks/20/77">RISKS-20.77</a>)

This is backwards?

ORGANISMS DO NOT ADAPT TO THEIR ENVIRONMENT. That is a fallacy called
adaptionism!!!

Evolution works by not anticipating the need for solutions but having enough
disparate solutions so that, given a problem, it's likely that there will be
a solution that works.

This resiliency is the real reason that Y2K was a nonissue. Systems as
brittle as the ones posited by the Y2K theorists don't work in practice and
have largely been eliminated from the ecosystem. New brittleness will be
discovered and some will be replaced by small scale alternatives and other
failures may be larger scale.

The big danger is the hubris associated with the notion that we must have a
vision to avoid pitfalls. Of course we shouldn't be stupid and should
anticipate obvious problems. But it is far more important to assume that we
will continue to surprised and need to have enough "fat" available to
survive problems.

It's also foolish to posit that we must model safety on static systems and
limit our possibilities to what we can do unaided and unenhanced. If we
eschew mechanical aids, why should we be more tolerant of cognitive aids
such as logic, reason and testing which often confound common sense and
faith.

In nature (to personify emergent behavior) systems only function in riskful
dynamic states. The static state for an organism or other ecosystem is
called death. The conversion of necessities into luxuries is most natural.
Skin, for example, is no longer an option.

Nature can't be fooled but we can do a fine job in deluding ourselves.

In an essay I'm writing, I was reminded of the book *Fatal Words* by Steven
Cushing [ISBN 0-226-13201-3].  It's about misunderstandings between pilots
and instructions from the ground and other consequences of the World War II
communications and avionics still in use. A great example of what happens
when certification and irrational fear of risk prevent improvements in
technology and safety.

Articles written during the first week or so of 2000 on abcnews.com have
a misdated notice at the bottom of the page:  "Copyright (C)1999 ABC
News Internet Ventures."  However, the dateline (which shows the place,
month, and day, but usually omits the year) and the URL (which has an
embedded date of the form YYMMDD) together clearly mark the article's
date.  One can still view articles exhibiting this glitch, for example:

<a href="http://www.abcnews.go.com/sections/science/DailyNews/clone_cells000105.html">http://www.abcnews.go.com/sections/science/DailyNews/clone_cells000105.html</a>

I notified abcnews.com Tech Support on January 6, and within several days,
all new articles had the correct copyright year.  This leads me to believe
that abcnews.com may use a hardcoded copyright year, which someone forgot
to update in a timely fashion.

I wonder how many programs and systems out there require manual year
rollover ... in this case, the slipup was of little consequence.

Greetings.  The current version of the PFIR (People For Internet
Responsibility) "Issues" document, and a status report regarding PFIR
activities, are now available via the PFIR Web site at:

   <a href="http://www.pfir.org">http://www.pfir.org</a>

The issues document covers a wide range of important Internet and Web topics.
It is (and will continue to be) a work in progress, and while quite
comprehensive is undergoing rapid expansion.  Many of the topics relate to
privacy issues, technology risks, and other matters that should be of
interest to current and potential Internet users.

Your input and comments regarding both of these documents would be very much
appreciated via the e-mail addresses indicated within the docs
themselves.

Thanks very much.
