NASDAQ Computers Crash, Halting Trading for More Than Two Hours
By Diana B. Henriques, The N.Y. Times, 16 July 1994 [PGN ABSTRACTING]

The U.S. automated over-the-counter NASDAQ marketplace went down for 2.5 hours
on the morning of Friday, 15 July 1994 when the computer system died.  (It was
finally restored just before N.Y. lunchtime.)  The problem was traced to an
upgrading to new communications software.  One new feature was added each
morning, beginning on Monday.  Thursday's fourth new feature resulted in some
glitches, but the systems folks decided to go ahead with the fifth feature on
Friday morning anyway.  It overloaded the mainframes (in Connecticut).
Unfortunately, the backup system (in Rockville, MD) was also being upgraded,
in order to ensure real-time compatibility.  The backup of course died as
well.  ``[The backup system is] really for natural disasters, power failures,
hardware problems that sort of thing,'' said Joseph R. Hardiman, Pres and CEO
of NASDAQ. ``When you're dealing with operating software or communication
software, it really doesn't help you.''

Volume on the day was cut by about one third, down from a typical 300 million
shares.  The effects were noted elsewhere as well, including several stock
indexes, spreading to the Chicago options pits, trading desks, and the media.
That in turn affected the large stock-index mutual funds.

Cable TV fiddlers ensnared by Garda's World Cup trap
Alan Murdoch in Dublin, The Independent, 15 Jul 1994

HUNDREDS of fraudsters in Cork have been nabbed in an ingenious "sting"
targeting three human weaknesses: greed, cable television, and the World Cup.
For two years Cork Communications, a cable television supplier to 30,000
homes, has been plagued by revenue-sapping fiddles. Former subscribers were
getting their "black box" cable decoders tampered with to let them watch
pay-only channels such as Sky Sport and the Movie Channel for free.  An
illicit black-box black market appeared, supplied by a wave of house
burglaries. "Hot" decoders were sold at an average Ir#60 a time. The result
was 4,500 miscreants watching on the cheap, defrauding the firm of an annual
Ir#750,000.  The solution had echoes of an FBI sting in the mid Eighties when
dozens of US crooks were lured with congratulations on winning a non-existent
competition, only to be arrested on arriving to collect their "winnings".  The
solution devised by Cork Communications blended hi-tech ingenuity with an
unerring sense of the one passion guaranteed to unite criminal classes this
summer.  A continuous message was broadcast on a cable channel which could be
received only by decoders on which the scrambler system had been illegally
by-passed. "To mark Ireland's first ever May Day bank holiday, YFBT Promotions
is offering an Irish World Cup T-shirt absolutely free," if promised, giving a
freephone number.  Some 2,000 replies were taped. Weeding out those who heard
about the offer in the pub, local gardai focused on former subscribers among
the earliest callers. Last Monday Cork District Court granted 416 search
warrants.  The next 48 hours saw a blitz of raids such as J Edgar Hoover would
have relished. An initial 150 people face charges and possible fines or
imprisonment. A Garda spokesman said. "I hope this will prove a deterrent.
We've scared a lot of people."  Incidentally, three letters of the name YFBT
Promotions stand for "Your Box is Tampered".

Some of you may have seen the rather unbalanced piece NBC Dateline piece on
the aircraft collision avoidance system, TCAS (July 14). The Dateline piece
implied that TCAS was unsafe and, in fact, increased the risk of flying.
Before the piece was aired, The Air Transport Association (ATA), Air Line
Pilots Association (ALPA), and the Allied Pilots Association (APA), along with
TCAS manufacturers, sent a joint letter to the President of NBC News
expressing concern about the Dateline: NBC segment on TCAS.  The letter states
that indications from those already interviewed, "as well as promotional
pieces already aired, clearly suggest that the segment will not present a
factual, balanced viewpoint of TCAS."

The fact is that TCAS substantially reduces the risk of midair collisions.
Airlines and pilots overwhelmingly support it, and in a number of incidents
pilots credit TCAS with saving lives.  The most recent testimony involved a
situation over the Pacific between Northwest and Cathay Pacific jumbo jets in
which TCAS helped avert a potential disaster.  The Northwest pilot later said
something to the effect that "700 people owe their lives to TCAS." (No mention
of this by NBC.)

FAA's R&amp;D Service has concluded after extensive analysis that when both
aircraft are equipped with TCAS 2, the risk of collision is reduced by a
factor of 26.  And, despite what was reported on Dateline, TCAS has not
induced a single collision or near collision.  These assertions are not made
lightly.  They come after four years of experience with the operational
evaluation of TCAS II that FAA began in 1990 in cooperation with the aviation
community, including pilots and controllers.  This represents some 25 million
hours of TCAS operation.  During that time, almost 14,000 reports from pilots
and controllers have been received.

A quote from one of FAA's Public Affairs staffers puts this in context:
"Clearly, the trend in television news is towards the news magazine shows,
versus the straight news news programs.  Even CNN, whose straight news
broadcasts are among the best, is losing audience share, according to recent
statistics.  Bucking this trend, I plan to focus a lot more of my attention on
televised sports, although I haven't broached that subject with my wife yet.
Sports is one thing that TV does exceptionally well.  Which reminds, if you
still think soccer is boring after watching Romario of Brazil and Baggio of
Italy, then you need help.  Might as well just jump in your jammies, put on
your slippers, watch the news magazine shows, and wait for the final bell."

Now it seems that since an aviation authoritative source is talking about the
RISKS that I have been identifying for over 4 years, it's OK to be wary.  But
how easy people forget.

It is not in the best interest of the government, the FAA, the airlines or the
aircraft manufacturers to openly discuss, much less admit what *could* go
wrooonnngggg.  RISKS readers should be referred to my original works on the
subject which appear in:

    RISKS: (You know the issue better than I do.)

    Security Insider Report,   August, 1993. "The FAA Discovers
    HERF: Is John Q. Flyer in Danger?"

    "Information Warfare: Chaos on the Electronic Superhighway,"
    Thunder's Mouth Press.  ISBN 1-56025-080-1.

In ongoing research in related areas, we are presently identifying at least 19
(nineteen) actual HERF attacks against high tech organizations.  We will be
publishing the results of this work when we are permitted to release the names
and events.

I stand by the original work despite the nay-sayers.  If anything, recent
events and current discussions fully support what I have been saying since
1990: Magnetic weapons are the nuclear arms of the Information Age, and
governments from hither and yon are trying to figure out what to do about it.
Kind of puts Michelangelo in perspective, doesn't it.

Thanks to RISKS for staying on the leading edge of technology and for not
being distracted by those who would prefer the subject be kept in the closet.

Since Lockerbie was caused by a device hidden by consumer electronics, and
since it appears to be at least suspected that navigational devices are
vulnerable to interference from outside consumer devices carried by passengers,
has anyone thought that a terrorist attack might be carried out on the avionics
instead?. It is not easy to screen for electronic devices in baggage etc. After
all the mail about the A320, I have come to realise that avionics are already
past the point of no return in modern jets - on an architecture programme last
night, Norman Foster was extolling the virtues of the 747; on the flight deck
was a very simple layout using four CRTs; is anyone claiming that the plane is
not avionics-dependent when the instruments are condensed in this manner?. I am
sure there are means of switching it all off, however what is the plane like to
fly after the switch-off? When my car's power steering failed, I was VERY glad
to be travelling slowly even though the steering would have been quite normal
to a van driver: I can imagine that this effect is at its worst in helicopters.

In the more mundane computer world, are any desktops vulnerable to reverse
TEMPEST attacks aimed at denying service?  We have some 286s I would quite
gladly test..

In <a href="/Risks/16/23">RISKS DIGEST 16.23</a> it was reported:
&gt; A cellular phone was also found on, although its owner claimed it had not
&gt; been used.                     ^

It should be noted that a cell phone periodically transmits to the control
site so that the system knows its location, even if it's not 'in use'. A
powered-up phone could easily generate the intermittent problems reported.

I agree we need more information on using electronic devices in aircraft.  The
following article has the most particular information I've seen yet.  However,
Idon't know if the suspect laptop computer was examined for FCC interference
compliance.  If all these "electronic devices" are so dangerous, why are our
aircraft so sensitive, and why aren't computer manufacturers shielding their
products better?

Compass Deflection

[begin quote] In cruise flight at FL310 25 NM west of the VOR, the #1 compass
suddenly precessed 10 degrees to the right.  I asked the First Flight
Attendant if any passenger-operated electronic devices were in operation in
the cabin.  She said that a passenger had just turned on his laptop computer.
I asked that the passenger turn off his laptop computer for a period of 10
minutes, which he did. I slaved the #1 compass, and it returned to normal
operation for the 10-minute period.  I then asked that the passenger turn on
his computer once again.  The # 1 compass immediately precessed 8 degrees to
the right.  The computer was then turned off for a 30-minute period during
which the #1 compass operation was verified as normal.  It was very evident to
all on the flight deck that the laptop computer operation was adversely
affecting the operation of the #1 compass.  I believe that the operation of
all passenger-operated electronic devices should be prohibited on airlines
until the safe operation of all these devices can be verified.  [end quote]

the process of greatly expanding it's network of Changeable Message Signs

installed in locations where they can observe the text on the nearby CMS.  (in
many remote locations, CalTrans is using VSAT technology to feed a CMS and

INTRODUCTION and BACKGROUND:

Organizations and individuals are becoming increasingly dependent on
sophisticated computing systems. In differing circumstances, the dependency
might for example center on the continuity of the service delivered by the
computing system, the overall performance level achieved, the real-time
response rate provided, the extent to which catastrophic failures are avoided,
or confidentiality violations prevented. These various concerns can be
subsumed into the single conceptual framework of dependability, for which
reliability, availability, safety and security, for example, can be considered
as particular attributes.

This, the first European Dependable Computing Conference, aims to provide a
European venue for researchers and practitioners from all over the world to
present and discuss their latest research results and developments. The
conference scope addresses all aspects of dependable computing, including:
fault-tolerant systems and components, safety critical systems, software
dependability, secure systems, validation, verification, testing and
evaluation. The conference program has been purposely organized in a single
track to encourage cross-fertilization between different viewpoints of
dependable computing.

EDCC-1 is the successor of two European conference series on fault
tolerance and dependability as well as on aspects of testing and diagnosis.
The first series, known as the "International Conference on Fault-Tolerant
Computing Systems" was organized (from 1982 up to 1991) by the German
Technical Interest Group "Fault-Tolerant Computing Systems". The other
series, known as the "International Conference on Fault-Tolerant Systems
and Diagnostics", was annually organized (from 1975 up to 1990) by
Universities and academic research institutions in the former
Czechoslovakia, Poland, Bulgaria and the former GDR. EDCC will be organized
every two or three years in different European countries.
