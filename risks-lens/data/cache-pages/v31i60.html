<p>
An Apple employee who died after his Tesla car hit a concrete barrier was
playing a video game at the time of the crash, investigators believe.
</p>
<p>
The US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said the car had been
driving semi-autonomously using Tesla's Autopilot software.
</p>
<p>
Tesla instructs drivers to keep their hands on the wheel in Autopilot mode.
</p>
<p>
But the NTSB said more crashes were foreseeable if Tesla did not implement
changes to its Autopilot system.
</p>
<p>
The authority has published the results of a two-year investigation,
following the crash in March 2018.
</p>
<p>
Tesla's Autopilot software steered the vehicle into the triangular ‘gore
area’ at a motorway intersection, and accelerated into a concrete barrier.

As discovered in the first beta of iOS 13.4, Apple is working on a new
‘CarKey’ feature that will allow an iPhone or an Apple Watch to unlock,
lock, and start NFC-compatible vehicles.

Computer security experts continue to express doubts that expensive new
voting machines are reliable, considering them almost as risky as earlier
discredited electronic systems. Called ballot-marking devices, the machines
have touchscreens for registering voter choices and print out paper records
scanned by optical readers. South Carolina voters will use the systems,
which are at least twice as expensive as the hand-marked paper ballot
option, in Saturday's primary. Daniel Lopresti, a computer scientist at
Lehigh University and a South Carolina election commissioner, said, “What
we worry is, what happens the next time if there's a programming bug, or a
hack or whatever, and it's done in a way that's not obvious?”  Said
University of South Carolina's Duncan Buell, “I don't know that we've ever
seen an election computer, a voting computer, whose software was done to a
high standard.”

<p>
Microsoft has come up with a new electronic voting system, called
ElectionGuard.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_6371b42359928a22ad5ccd6d5369aef7">https://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_6371b42359928a22ad5ccd6d5369aef7</a>
</p>
<p>
(Yes, OK, <em>that</em> Microsoft.  But it does sound possible.)
</p>
<p>
First off, this is not online or remote voting.  This is a vote tabulation
system.  You vote on a device, a memory card is read and counted, and you
get a paper record of your vote.  The individual votes are encrypted using
homomorphic encryption (probably a version of Rivest's <em>Three Ballot</em>
algorithm).  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThreeBallot">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThreeBallot</a>
</p>
<p>
ElectionGuard is open source, so I imagine that electronic voting
researchers will be looking under the hood.  I'd like to know how you
prevent election officials from reading the printouts that voters receive
(but that's more a matter of training and process).  I'd like to know how
many random challenges you make, taking real votes and checking to see if
they've been tabulated properly.  (There are likely some legal issues in
that regard.)

  Andrew Walz calls himself a <em>proven business leader</em> and a <em>passionate
  advocate for students</em>.  Walz, a Republican from Rhode Island, is running
  for Congress with the tagline, “Let's make change in Washington together,”
  or so his Twitter account claimed.
</p>
<p>
  Earlier this month, Walz's account received a coveted blue checkmark from
  Twitter as part of the company's broader push to verify the authenticity
  of many Senate, House and gubernatorial candidates currently running for
  office. Twitter has framed this effort as key to helping Americans find
  reliable information about politicians in the leadup to the 2020 election.
</p>
<p>
  But there's just one problem: Walz does not exist. The candidate is the
  creation of a 17-year-old high school student from upstate New York, CNN
  Business has learned.
</p>
<p>
  The student, who CNN Business spoke to with the permission of his parents
  and has agreed not to name as he is a minor, said he was ‘bored’ over the
  holidays and created the fake account to test Twitter's election integrity
  efforts.

Not long ago, curator Natalie Luvera began to worry about the strangest item
in the National Atomic Testing Museum's collection of artifacts — a tiny
1920s device designed to restore lost manhood by irradiating the manliest of
human body parts.
</p>
<p>
Was the gold-plated <em>scrotal radiendocrinator</em> still dangerous after nearly
a century? Luvera tested it with a Geiger counter, got a worrisome reading
and called in a radioactivity response team to double-check. “They came
down and said, ‘Nope, you shouldn't have that here.’ ” […]
</p>
<p>
The device was the brainchild of an extraordinary quack named William
J.A. Bailey, who liked to describe radiation as <em>eternal sunshine</em>.  He also
hawked bottles of Radithor — <em>certified radioactive water</em> — that were touted as a cure-all for disorders such as impotence and fatigue.

<em>It works over a longer distance and without the need to be in

</p>
<p>
EXCERPT:
</p>
<p>
Researchers have discovered a new means to target voice-controlled devices
by propagating ultrasonic waves through solid materials in order to
interact with and compromise them using inaudible voice commands without
the victims' knowledge.
</p>
<p>
Called SurfingAttack,
&lt;<a href="https://surfingattack.github.io/papers/NDSS-surfingattack.pdf">https://surfingattack.github.io/papers/NDSS-surfingattack.pdf</a>&gt; the attack
leverages the unique properties of acoustic transmission in solid materials
— such as tables—to “enable multiple rounds of interactions between the
voice-controlled device and the attacker over a longer distance and without
the need to be in line-of-sight.”
</p>
<p>
In doing so, it's possible for an attacker to interact with the devices
using the voice assistants, hijack SMS two-factor authentication codes, and
even place fraudulent calls, the researchers outlined in the paper, thus
controlling the victim device inconspicuously.
</p>
<p>
The research was published by a group of academics from Michigan State
University, Washington University in St. Louis, Chinese Academy of
Sciences, and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.
</p>
<p>
The results were presented at the Network Distributed System Security
Symposium (NDSS) on February 24 in San Diego.

<li>Phishing scams in which hackers pose as trusted figures to trick
   people into handing over passwords are getting increasingly sophisticated.</li>
   <li>Security experts describe an arms race between services that weed out
   scammers and attackers developing new tricks and workarounds.</li>
   <li>Phishing is on the rise, and costing over $57 million from more than
   114,000 victims in the US last year, according to a recent FBI report.</li>
</ul>
EXCERPT:
<p>
Hackers don't break in, they log in.
</p>
<p>
That mantra, often repeated by security experts, represents a rule of thumb:
The vast majority of breaches are the result of stolen passwords, not
high-tech hacking tools.
</p>
<p>
These break-ins are on the rise. Phishing scams—in which attackers pose
as a trustworthy party to trick people into handing over personal details or
account information—were the most common type of Internet crime last
year, according to a recent FBI report
&lt;<a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-releases-the-internet-crime-complaint-center-2019-internet-crime-report">https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-releases-the-internet-crime-complaint-center-2019-internet-crime-report</a>&gt;.
People lost more than $57.8 million in 2019 as the result of phishing,
according to the report, with over 114,000 victims targeted in the US.
</p>
<p>
And as phishing becomes more profitable, hackers are becoming increasingly
sophisticated in the methods they use to steal passwords, according to
Tanmay Ganacharya, a principal director in Microsoft's Security Research
team.
</p>
<p>
“Most of the attackers have now moved to phishing because it's easy. If I
can convince you to give me your credentials, it's done. There's nothing
more that I need,” Ganacharya told Business Insider.
</p>
<p>
Ganacharya monitors phishing tactics in order to build machine-learning
systems that root out scams for people using Microsoft services, including
Windows, Outlook, and Azure, Microsoft's cloud computing service. This
week, Microsoft announced
&lt;<a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/02/20/delivering-on-the-promise-of-security-ai-to-help-defenders-protect-todays-hybrid-environments/">https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/02/20/delivering-on-the-promise-of-security-ai-to-help-defenders-protect-todays-hybrid-environments/</a>&gt;
that
it will begin selling its threat-protection services for platforms
including Linux, iOS, and Android.
</p>
<p>
Ganacharya spoke to Business Insider about the trends in phishing that his
team has observed. Many of the tactics aren't new, but he said attackers
are constantly finding new ways to work around defenses like Microsoft's
threat protection. Here's what he described…

Researchers say the vulnerability impacts virtually all smartphones on the
market<sup>*</sup></p>
<p>
EXCERPT:
</p>
<p>
A security vulnerability in LTE can be exploited to sign up for
subscriptions or paid website services at someone else's expense, new
research suggests.
</p>
<p>
According to researchers
&lt;<a href="https://news.rub.de/english/press-releases/2020-02-17-lte-vulnerability-attackers-can-impersonate-other-mobile-phone-users">https://news.rub.de/english/press-releases/2020-02-17-lte-vulnerability-attackers-can-impersonate-other-mobile-phone-users</a>&gt;
from Ruhr-Universitaet Bochum, the flaw exists in the 4G mobile
communication standard and permits smartphone user impersonation, which
could allow attackers to “start a subscription at the expense of others or
publish secret company documents under someone else's identity.”
</p>
<p>
The research, titled IMP4GT: IMPersonation Attacks in 4G NeTworks, is the
work of David Rupprecht, Katharina Kohls, Thorsten Holz, and Christina
Pöpper.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
The IMP4GT attack &lt;<a href="https://imp4gt-attacks.net/">https://imp4gt-attacks.net/</a>&gt; impacts “all devices that
communicate with LTE,” which includes <em>virtually all</em> smartphones, tablets,
and some Internet of Things (IoT) devices.
</p>
<p>
Software-defined radios are a key element of IMP4GT. These devices are able
to read the communications channels between a mobile device and base
station, and by using them, it is possible to trick a smartphone into
considering the radio is the base station—and dupe the network into
treating the radio as the mobile phone.
</p>
<p>
Once this channel of communication is compromised, it is time to start
manipulating data packets being sent between an LTE device and base station.
</p>
<p>
“The problem is the lack of integrity protection: data packets are
transmitted encrypted between the mobile phone and the base station, which
protects the data against eavesdropping.  However, it is possible to modify
the exchanged data packets. We don't know what is where in the data packet,
but we can trigger errors by changing bits from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0.”
</p>
<p>
These errors can then force a mobile phone and base station to either
decrypt or encrypt messages, converting information into plaintext or
creating a situation in which an attacker is able to send commands without
authorization. […]

<p>
EXCERPT:
</p>
<p>
The White House's recent efforts to chart a national artificial intelligence
(AI) policy are welcome and, frankly, overdue. Funding for AI research and
updating agency IT systems is a good start. So is guidance for agencies as
they begin to regulate industry use of AI. But there's a glaring gap: The
White House has been silent about the rules that apply when agencies use AI
to perform critical governance tasks.
</p>
<p>
&lt;<a href="https://about.bgov.com/news/white-house-proposes-92-billion-it-budget-in-fy-2021/">https://about.bgov.com/news/white-house-proposes-92-billion-it-budget-in-fy-2021/</a>&gt;

</p>
<p>
This matters because, of all the ways AI is transforming our world, some of
the most worrying come at the intersection of AI and the awesome power of
the state. AI drives the facial recognition police use to surveil citizens.
It enables the autonomous weapons changing warfare. And it powers the tools
judges use to make life-changing bail, sentencing and parole decisions.
Concerns about each have fueled debate and, as to facial recognition in
particular, new laws banning use.
</p>
<p>
&lt;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-24/cops-spying-on-londoners-faces-sparks-human-rights-concerns">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-24/cops-spying-on-londoners-faces-sparks-human-rights-concerns</a>&gt;

</p>
<p>
Sitting just beyond the headlines, however, is a little-known fact: AI use
already is pervasive in government. Prohibition for most uses is not an
option, or at least not a wise one. Needed instead is a frank conversation
about how to give the government the resources it needs to develop
high-quality and fairly deployed AI tools and build sensible accountability
mechanisms around their use.
</p>
<p>
We know because we led a team of lawyers and computer scientists at Stanford
and New York universities to advise federal agencies on how to develop and
oversee their new algorithmic toolkit.
</p>
<p>
Our research
&lt;<a href="https://law.stanford.edu/education/only-at-sls/law-policy-lab/practicums-2018-2019/administering-by-algorithm-artificial-intelligence-in-the-regulatory-state/acus-report-for-administering-by-algorithm-artificial-intelligence-in-the-regulatory-state/#slsnav-report">https://law.stanford.edu/education/only-at-sls/law-policy-lab/practicums-2018-2019/administering-by-algorithm-artificial-intelligence-in-the-regulatory-state/acus-report-for-administering-by-algorithm-artificial-intelligence-in-the-regulatory-state/#slsnav-report</a>&gt;
shows that AI use spans government. By our estimates, half of major federal
agencies have experimented with AI. Among the 160 AI uses we found, some —
such as facial recognition—are fueling public outcries. But many others
fly under the radar. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) uses AI to
flag insider trading; the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services uses it
to ferret out health care fraud. The Social Security Administration is
piloting AI tools to help decide who gets disability benefits, and the
Patent and Trademark Office to decide who gets patent protection.
</p>
<p>
Still other agencies are developing AI tools to communicate with the public,
by sifting millions of consumer complaints or using chatbots to field
questions from welfare beneficiaries, asylum seekers and taxpayers.
</p>
<p>
Our research also highlights AI's potential to make government work better
and at lower cost. AI tools that help administrative judges spot errors in
draft decisions can shrink backlogs that leave some veterans waiting years
&lt;<a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/news/2018/09/10/watchdog-report-the-va-benefits-backlog-is-higher-than-officials-say/">https://www.militarytimes.com/news/2018/09/10/watchdog-report-the-va-benefits-backlog-is-higher-than-officials-say/</a>&gt;
(sometimes, close to a decade) for benefits. AI can help ensure that the
decision to launch a potentially ruinous enforcement action does not reflect
the mistakes, biases, or whims of human prosecutors. And AI can help make
more precise judgments about which drugs threaten public health.
</p>
<p>
But the picture is not all rosy.  […]

New Mexico's attorney general sued Google on Thursday, saying the tech giant
used its educational products to spy on the state's children and families.
</p>
<p>
Google collected a trove of students' personal information, including data
on their physical locations, websites they visited, YouTube videos they
watched and their voice recordings, Hector Balderas, New Mexico's attorney
general, said in a federal lawsuit.
</p>
<p>
“The consequences of Google's tracking cannot be overstated: Children are
being monitored by one of the largest data mining companies in the world,
at school, at home, on mobile devices, without their knowledge and without
the permission of their parents,” the lawsuit said.

<p>
Over the last eight years, Google has emerged as the predominant tech brand
in American public schools
&lt;<a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19734145/document_5.pdf">https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19734145/document_5.pdf</a>&gt;,
outpacing rivals like Apple and Microsoft by offering a suite of
inexpensive, easy-to-use tools.
</p>
<p>
Today, more than half of the nation's public schools—and 90 million
students and teachers globally—use free Google Education apps like Gmail
and Google Docs. More than 25 million students and teachers also use
Chromebooks, laptops that run on the company's Chrome operating system, the
lawsuit said.
</p>
<p>
In September, Google agreed to pay a $170 million fine to settle federal
and New York State charges that it illegally harvested the personal data
&lt;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/04/technology/google-youtube-fine-ftc.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/04/technology/google-youtube-fine-ftc.html</a>&gt;
of children on YouTube.
</p>
<p>
The new lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of New
Mexico, claimed that Google violated the federal Children's Online Privacy
Protection Act. The law requires companies to obtain a parent's consent
before collecting the name, contact information and other personal details
from a child under 13.
</p>
<p>
The lawsuit also said Google deceived schools, parents, teachers and
students by telling them that were no privacy concerns with its education
products when, in fact, the company had amassed a trove of potentially
sensitive details on students' online activities and locations. […]

Cybersecurity researchers today uncovered a new high-severity hardware
vulnerability residing in the widely-used Wi-Fi chips manufactured by
Broadcom and Cypress—apparently powering over a billion devices,
including smartphones, tablets, laptops, routers, and IoT gadgets.
</p>
<p>
Dubbed ‘Kr00k’ and tracked as CVE-2019-15126, the flaw could let nearby
remote attackers intercept and decrypt some wireless network packets
transmitted over-the-air by a vulnerable device.
</p>
<p>
The attacker does not need to be connected to the victim's wireless network
and the flaw works against vulnerable devices using WPA2-Personal or
WPA2-Enterprise protocols, with AES-CCMP encryption, to protect their
network traffic.
</p>
<p>
“Our tests confirmed some client devices by Amazon (Echo, Kindle), Apple
(iPhone, iPad, MacBook), Google (Nexus), Samsung (Galaxy), Raspberry (Pi
3), Xiaomi (RedMi), as well as some access points by Asus and Huawei, were
vulnerable to Kr00k,” ESET researchers said.
</p>
<p>
According to the researchers &lt;<a href="https://www.eset.com/int/kr00k/">https://www.eset.com/int/kr00k/</a>&gt;, the Kr00k
flaw is somewhat related to the KRACK attack

<p>
OK, first off, to let you know that I know what I'm talking about, I put
myself through university by working in the medical field, first as a
practical nurse (I spent considerable time working in an isolation ward),
and later as an industrial first aid attendant.  (My required non-physics
elective at university was medical physiology.)  I've also been an emergency
management volunteer for a couple of decades.
</p>
<p>
Now I've talked about security theatre in regard to COVID-19, and we are
discussing other issues related to the coronavirus.  But one of the things
that has bugged me ever since it started hitting the news is the masks.
</p>
<p>
Masks won't keep you from getting COVID-19, or any other droplet bourne
virus.  (At least, they don't reduce your risk very much.)  The paper face
masks provide next to no protection in this regard, and the N95 masks aren't
much better.  Droplet bourne viruses will still get on your skin, on your
face, and into your eyes, and simple daily activities make you touch your
skin and face and mouth and eyes and provide the viruses a path inside.  You
don't need to inhale the virus to get it, and, if you do get COVID-19, it
probably will be from some other pathway than inhaling it.  This is why
frequent (<em>very</em> frequent) handwashing is important.  (Hand sanitizer is
good, too.  If you use it frequently.)
</p>
<p>
Masks are useful, if <em>you</em> have the virus, in preventing you giving it to
other people.  (Not a complete prevention, mind, but useful.)  So, if you
are wearing a face mask in public during this epidemic, you are making one
of two statements: 1) I AM INFECTED WITH THE COVID-19 VIRUS!!  or 2) I AM
STUPID AND IGNORANT!!
</p>
<p>
This advice, by the way, applies to influenza as well.  Which brings up
another point: if you are worried about the COVID-19 virus, and still
haven't yet gotten a flu shot, you are stupid and ignorant.  Even in China,
you are much, much more likely to get the flu than COVID-19.  Even in China,
the likelihood that the next person you meet will have COVID-19 is about
.0001.  (Probably somewhat less.)  But if you go out into a crowd (if you
can <em>find</em> a crowd in China these days), you are likely to encounter
somebody with the flu.  Having a flu shot probably doesn't reduce your risk
of getting COVID-19, but it does reduce your risk of getting the flu.  If
you get the flu, then you may have to get tested for COVID-19, and that puts
that much more demand on the system and resources.
</p>
<p>
Wash your hands.
</p>
<p>
If you haven't got a flu shot, get one.
</p>
<p>
Don't panic buy, horde, or misuse masks and gloves.  If you need them,
you'll get them.  (If other people haven't been panic buying and hoarding.)

<em>Thousands ordered masks that let them unlock their phones during
outbreaks. But this viral art project doesn't just work with surveillance
technology—it works against it, too.</em>
</p>
<p>
EXCERPT:
</p>
<p>
Two weeks ago, Danielle Baskin had an idea for a tongue-in-cheek art
project. Now, she's suddenly big in China.
</p>
<p>
While talking with friends about the coronavirus outbreak
&lt;<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/615290/how-to-prepare-for-the-coronavirus-covid19/">https://www.technologyreview.com/s/615290/how-to-prepare-for-the-coronavirus-covid19/</a>&gt;,
Baskin, an artist in San Francisco, realized that people using face masks to
protect themselves from infection would have trouble unlocking phones that
use facial recognition. (This has indeed been a problem
&lt;<a href="https://www.abacusnews.com/tech/facial-recognition-fails-china-people-wear-masks-avoid-coronavirus/article/3048006">https://www.abacusnews.com/tech/facial-recognition-fails-china-people-wear-masks-avoid-coronavirus/article/3048006</a>&gt;.)
She quickly created a prototype of a mask printed with a face—not <em>your</em>
face, but rather unique faces of imaginary people generated using artificial
intelligence &lt;<a href="https://www.thispersondoesnotexist.com/">https://www.thispersondoesnotexist.com/</a>&gt;—and posted her
idea on Twitter &lt;<a href="https://twitter.com/djbaskin/status/1228798382598000640">https://twitter.com/djbaskin/status/1228798382598000640</a>&gt;:
“Protect people from viral epidemics while still being able to unlock your
phone.”
</p>
<p>
The demand was immediate. Those interested in the idea include cancer
patients who want to customize their masks, doctors who work in children's
hospitals and don't want to scare kids—and people in China. Her invention
was picked up by Chinese media, and now her waiting list has over 2,000
people on it, many of them with Chinese email accounts. And it's not just a
request for one or two masks each: one potential customer requested 10,000
masks. Eight people asked if they could be her distributor. Baskin won't be
fulfilling these orders for a while—there's a global mask shortage right
now—but the masks do work, as long as you set FaceID to recognize you when
you're wearing it.
</p>
<p>
“I think these are so cool as a social object and art object,” says
Robert Furberg, a researcher who studies biometrics in health care.  “It's
the fusion of something threatening and protective at the same time, and I
just find that so compelling.”  He is one of those who reached out to
Baskin; his wife is a nurse and has complained about the inconvenience of
masks and FaceID. For him, the demand itself is a form of social commentary:
“It's just so 2020.”
</p>
<p>
But while most people are simply concerned about being able to use their
phones while wearing a mask, they may discover a surprising bonus. Baskin
says there's an element of <em>anti</em>-surveillance built in.  “[The mask]
appears to be working with facial recognition, but it will never actually be
your face,” she says. It's tricking the technology and protecting your
biometric information: “The image is something your friends could identify
as you but that machine learning can't, and it shows that face recognition
has errors.”  Art against surveillance
</p>
<p>
Arty anti-surveillance devices and techniques have become more popular in
recent years, from anti-facial-recognition face paint to an <em>invisibility
cloak</em> &lt;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.14667">https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.14667</a>&gt; that can block object detectors;

to the simple face masks that protesters in Hong Kong and India have used to
hide their face from cameras. The media reports breathlessly
&lt;<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/clothes-accessories-that-outsmart-facial-recognition-tech-2019-10#images-from-echizens-lab-shows-how-the-visor-blocks-ais-ability-to-detect-a-face-6">https://www.businessinsider.com/clothes-accessories-that-outsmart-facial-recognition-tech-2019-10#images-from-echizens-lab-shows-how-the-visor-blocks-ais-ability-to-detect-a-face-6</a>&gt;
on each advance, but for the most part, they are more political commentary
than useful tactics for the average person

Those projects, in fact, might be less helpful if they went mainstream,
because wide adoption could lead to an arms race that enables the invasive
technology to route around defenses. […]

To counter the plans to use face recognition on campus 400 photos of staff
and athletes were run through a facial recognition system (Amazon's)
comparing to a mugshot database with the result that 58 of them were
incorrectly matched.  The majority of the incorrect matches were people of

“This style of technology could also follow babies beyond the crib. The
electronics firm ViewSonic said last month that it was building a
whiteboard-mounted ‘mood sensing’ device that could monitor students and
alert teachers as to how engaged a class may be. The company's chief
technology officer, Craig Scott, said in a statement that the system was
still in early development but was being designed to ‘improve class

“But this level of computer-aided surveillance, Brooks said, can also have
a corrosive effect on parents' sense of self-worth and state of mind. The

</p>
<p>
“We have this mind-set, this mentality, that when kids are involved, we
don't have to be rational. Any risk mitigation is worth the cost we have to
pay,” Brooks said. But the system “undermines parents' feelings of basic
competence: that they can't trust themselves to take care of their babies
without a piece of $500 equipment.”

They scored $80 million by tricking a network into routing funds to Sri
Lanka and the Philippines and then using a <em>money mule</em> to pick up the cash.
</p>
<p>
The bills are called supernotes. Their composition is three-quarters cotton
and one-quarter linen paper, a challenging combination to produce. Tucked
within each note are the requisite red and blue security fibers. The
security stripe is exactly where it should be and, upon close inspection, so
is the watermark. Ben Franklin's apprehensive look is perfect, and betrays
no indication that the currency, supposedly worth one hundred dollars, is
fake.
</p>
<p>
Most systems designed to catch forgeries fail to detect the supernotes.  The
massive counterfeiting effort that produced these bills appears to have
lasted decades. Many observers tie the fake bills to North Korea, and some
even hold former leader Kim Jong-Il personally responsible, citing a
supposed order he gave in the 1970s, early in his rise to power. Fake
hundreds, he reasoned, would simultaneously give the regime much-needed hard
currency and undermine the integrity of the US economy.  The self-serving
fraud was also an attempt at destabilization.

The Fido Alliance, an organization committed to eliminating the need for
passwords, received a big boost last week when Apple signed up as a board
member. Fido stands for Fast IDentity Online.
</p>
<p>
Apple apparently wasn't ready to announce its support immediately, as tweets
from a Fido Alliance conference were quickly deleted, but as of today, the
news is official.
</p>
<p>
French site MacG spotted a now-deleted tweet that had a photo (below) of a
conference slide showing the Apple logo and the text ‘New Board Member’.
</p>
<p>
While that tweet didn't stay up for long, Apple has today been added to the
official website as a board-level member, alongside such tech companies as
Amazon, Arm, Facebook, Google, Intel, Microsoft, and Samsung. A number of
big-name finance companies are also board members, including American
Express, ING, Mastercard, Paypal, Visa, and Wells Fargo.

The case highlights issues that have plagued 911 phone systems across the
country since the advent of smartphones. Cellphone privacy settings and
outdated dispatch mapping systems continue to frustrate first responders
when they can't find callers.
</p>
<p>
Landline numbers are much easier for these systems to pinpoint. But over 80
percent of the calls to the nation's 911 centers are from cellphones, The
Washington Post has previously reported.
</p>
<p>
The Federal Communications Commission has required cellphone carriers to
improve the transfer of information to 911 centers. The carriers have until
2021 to make sure transmitted locations are within 50 yards 80 percent of
the time.

  Some injuries prevent precise location disclosure. Geolocation exactitude

</p>
<p>
Researchers at Rice University have developed a technique to improve
security for Internet of Things (IoT) devices significantly, while using far
less energy. The new technique is a hardware solution based on the power
management circuitry found in most central processing chips. The method
leverages power regulators to muddle information leaked by the power
consumption of encryption circuits. A breakthrough last year by the team
generated paired security keys based on fingerprint-like defects unique to
every computer chip.  “This year, the story is similar, but we are not
generating keys,” said Rice's Kaiyuan Yang.  “We are looking at defending
against a new type of attack that is specifically for IoT and mobile
systems.”

Quoting in part from TechCrunch:

<p>
&lt;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/02/robinhood-suffers-prolonged-outage-on-the-day-the-dow-enjoyed-its-single-biggest-point-gain/">https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/02/robinhood-suffers-prolonged-outage-on-the-day-the-dow-enjoyed-its-single-biggest-point-gain/</a>&gt;
</p>
<p>
Robinhood, the startup with a stock trading app …, suffered one of its
worst outages on one of the busiest trading days of the year.
</p>
<p>
As the Dow Jones Industrial Average enjoyed the single biggest point-gain in
the history of the index, Robinhood's application fell prey to an error that
locked users out of the service for the duration of Monday's trading.
</p>
<p>
One potential cause of the outages could just be the high trading volumes
that have accompanied highly volatile markets over the past month. While
there were some early reports that the bug was caused by a Leap Day bug, the
company has denied that a February 29th error was at fault.
</p>
<p>
The company's mistake could cost its users lots of money as they sought to
trade on stocks that were hit in last week's string of losses due to
investor worries over the impact the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, would have
on the global economy.
</p>
<p>
The company said “We don't have an estimate when the issue will be resolved
but all of us at Robinhood are working as hard as we can to resume
service.”
</p>
<p>
I became aware of this because of a friend who had successfully bet (via
options), last week, that the market would go down significantly over virus
fears. When he went to sell his options today he could not because of the
Robinhood failure. I do not want to make light of his pain, but it would be
ironic if he suffered this loss because of a virus.

<p>
Personal accountability for failure to prevent phishing assault is a common
problem in industry, government, and non-profit organizations.
</p>
<p>
Employment laws prevent penalties: demotion, fines, dismissal for cause
though the brand outrage arising from these incidents can be severe.
</p>
<p>
The essay raises important questions about <em>repeat offenders</em>—those
individuals who neglect to practice IT hygiene for lack of competence,
professionalism, or incautious actions.
</p>
<p>
Given that phishing is unlikely to decay in frequency, education appears to
be the only means to suppress it. If the CEO activates a phished assault,
the mess gets cleaned up and communication lockdown is enforced—until it
leaks to the press. If general slave #6 initiates it, what do most
organizations do? Promote the individual?
</p>
<p>
Risk: Weak organizational deterrence against IT threats.

Clearview AI, a startup that compiles billions of photos for facial
recognition technology, said it lost its entire client list to hackers.  The
company said it has patched the unspecified flaw that allowed the breach to
happen.
</p>
<p>
In a statement, Clearview AI's attorney Tor Ekeland said that while security
is the company's top priority, “Unfortunately, data breaches are a part of
life. Our servers were never accessed.” He added that the company continues
to strengthen its security procedures and that the flaw has been patched.
</p>
<p>
Clearview AI continues “to work to strengthen our security,” Ekeland said.

In my January column, I described the influence of feng shui on the Chinese
real estate market. Although it would be hard to match the pervasive
influence of traditional Chinese superstition in real estate and other areas
of commerce, the Chinese are not alone. One of the most interesting survey
results I've ever come across is a 2007 Gallup poll that showed 13 percent
of American adults would be bothered if given a hotel room on the thirteenth
floor (Carroll 2007). Thirteen percent.  Furthermore, nine percent of
respondents said they would be bothered enough to ask for a different
room. As is the case for many traditional superstitions, the majority of
those who said they would be bothered were women.

The risk? At best (and not very good):

<p>
We're hard-wired to connect dots. When Thing 1 happens, and then Thing 2
happens, we humans are very likely to conclude that Thing 1 caused Thing 2,
even if they're completely unrelated; it's a phenomenon psychologists call
the <em>illusion of causality</em>.

attorneys across the state are crediting the group with expediting an

Mass exoneration or mass incarceration. Batch processing saves individual
adjudication costs. Trust that the algorithm doesn't <em>overlook</em> an innocent
case. Data fallout/dropout is a common occurrence in big business. This
situation certainly exemplifies the situation.  Albeit, it is one-off usage.

<blockquote>
<p>
  A seemingly small line error has created a major problem for Taunton's
  assessors ” and it's going to cost taxpayers.  Officials were forced to
  essentially reboot their billing process after a software upgrade meant
  that local public school property was added to the list of taxable
  properties, they say.
</p>
<p>
  The snafu came when the non-profit Head Start building, adjacent to
  Taunton High School, was added to the system as a taxable property, which
  generated invoices for all of the school buildings at the site, Assessor
  Richard Conti told the City Council last week.
</p>
<p>
  The assessed value of Taunton's commercial and industrial properties shot
  up by $136,846,200, at least on paper. The school property was then logged
  as being on the hook for $4.2 million in taxes for what is nontaxable
  property, Conti said.
</p>
<p>
  The oversight was only caught when the school superintendent sent the
  bills back to the assessor's office.  “This all happened as a result of a
  perfect storm of errors that went into sequence that no one has ever
  experienced before,” Conti said during the Feb. 18 meeting. “This
  happened in a manner that none of our peers, none of the people in the
  Department of Revenue would have caught because of the software.”

Large error!!!
</p>
<p>
Risks Digest has correctly quoted the ZDNet article, which says that 64-bit
Linux runs out of seconds in the year 29,227,702,659.
</p>
<p>
But I believed that we have about ten times longer to wait, and that the
true S2^63 instant is about   AD 292,277,026,596-12-04 Sun 15:30:08 GMT
(Gregorian)  .
</p>
<p>
I find that, by Firefox JavaScript and by Windows Calculator, that
      (2^63)/(60*60*24*365.2425) + 1970 is 292277026596.9277 , to 4 decimal
places.
</p>
<p>
ZDNet dropped the final 6 of the year count.
</p>
<p>
But I now see that my date/time above, which the ZDNet author might have
seen a copy of, cannot be quite right; 1970 and …6596 are manifestly in
different phases of the 400-year cycle of the secular Gregorian Calendar,
and therefore the value 365.2425 is not precisely suitable.
</p>
<p>
The moral is that a reader should, whenever possible, check any printed
figure to see whether it is, at least, perhaps right.

Is basic maritime navigation no longer taught to merchant crew? I've never
navigated in open water, but I still know some of the basics, like how to
read a compass, to leave green navigation markers to port and red to
starboard, etc.
</p>
<p>
As far as other vessels go, they should be clearly marked and lit — red
light on the port side, green on the starboard, white light on the stern and
I believe at the top of the mast, and the <em>rules of the road</em> clearly state
to which side you should leave the other vessel if your courses appear to
intersect. Calling out <em>NATO and Russian warships</em> specifically is a form of
scare words—they should be marked and lit like any other vessel, unless
operating under wartime conditions, in which case it's incumbent on <em>them</em>
to avoid collisions.
</p>
<p>
I'm not saying that losing your GPS-based navigation is trivial, but any
ocean-going vessel and its crew should already be equipped to at least have
a reasonable chance of avoiding a navigation-related catastrophe.
