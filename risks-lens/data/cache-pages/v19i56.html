  [This is from the PerForce mailing list, PerForce is a source-code control
  system that doesn't use mounted drives, but instead uses TCP/IP socket
  communications to check code in and out.]

Well, I just spent several hours tracking something down that I think is SO
brain-dead that it must be called evil.  I hope this will save someone else
some hassle.

There's an NT box on my desk that someone else uses every now and then.
This machine is otherwise used as my programming box and backup server.

All of a sudden, my programming files were being corrupted in odd places.  I
thought "hmm, my copy must be corrupt".  So I refreshed the files.  No
change.  "hmm, the code depot copy must be corrupt"..  Checked from other
machines.  No problem there.  Viewed the file from a web based change
browser in Internet Explorer.  Same corruption in the file.  Telnet-ed to
the server machine and just cat-ed the file to the terminal.  Same problem.
What's going on?

The lines that were corrupted were of the form
#define one 1 /* foo menu */
#define two 2 /* bar baz */
What I always saw ON THIS MACHINE ONLY was:
#define one 1 /* foo     */
#  fine two 2 /* bar baz */

Can you guess what was happening?  Turns out, someone had inadvertently
installed this piece of garbage called CyberSitter, which purports to
protect you from nasty internet content.  Turns out that it does this by
patching the TCP drivers and watching the data flow over EVERY TCP STREAM.
Can you spot the offense word in my example?  It's "NUDE".  Seems that
cybersitter doesn't care if there are other characters in between.  So it
blanks out "nu */ #de" without blanking out the punctuation and line breaks.
Very strange and stupid.

It also didn't like the method name "RefreshItems" in another file, since
there is obviously a swear word embedded in there.  Sheesh.

It's so bad it's almost funny.  Hope this brightens your day as much as it
brighted mine :-).

Accused gay sailor Timothy ("the other one") McVeigh and the U.S. Navy
certainly have their differences, but both sides can agree on one thing:
America Online screwed up.  For once, AOL agrees.  This morning the online
giant finally admitted that it handed over McVeigh's personal information to
the Navy without a court order, saying in a statement "This clearly should
not have happened and we regret it."

AOL's almost-apology came just before McVeigh's lawyers clashed with
government attorneys defending the Navy's decision to kick him out.  McVeigh
claims that the Navy's prudish "is-he-or-isn't-he" sex snooping was overly
nosy and intrusive — so much so that it violated the law.  At a hearing in
Washington, D.C., federal court, attorney Christopher Wolf argued that Navy
investigators "did the electronic equivalent" of "breaking into a file
cabinet." Not so, responded David Glass, a Justice Department lawyer
representing the Navy.  "There is nothing in that statute that precludes the
government from calling and asking," he said.  Of course, that phrasing
neatly begs the multiple procedural violations that the Navy apparently
committed in the course of that phone call.

Next step is for Judge Stanley Sporkin to decide whether to issue a
preliminary injunction that would keep McVeigh in uniform past this Friday,
when he's scheduled to get the boot.  Sporkin didn't say when he'd rule, but
he did note that McVeigh could have a tidy little case against AOL, should
he decide to sue them too: "That's why they're cutting and running here."
Will he? Said McVeigh's attorney afterward: "We're keeping our options
open." Smart lad.

Hacking 101, by Declan McCullagh (declan@well.com)
The Netly News (<a href="http://netlynews.com/">http://netlynews.com/</a>), 21 Jan 1998

The end of senior year for most high school students is a time for college
decisions, vacation planning and beer-tinged teenage revelry.  Not so for
Justin Boucher.  Today the Milwaukee, Wisconsin-area native will be expelled
from Greenfield High School because of an article he wrote entitled "So You
Want To Be A Hacker."  Published under a pseudonym in an unofficial student
newspaper, it described in colorful (and sometimes profane) language how
enterprising snoops could break into the high school's computer network.

The advice ranged from the glaringly obvious ("Some commonly used passwords
at very stupid schools are...") to the Hacker Code of Ethics ("Never harm,
alter or damage any computers").  The finer points of hacker morality and
teenage tomfoolery, however, were lost on irate school officials, who
expelled Boucher for one year.  [...]

[This is an abridged version of an essay on Risks of the EGPWS.  The full
text is available at the URL &lt;<a href="http://math.isu.edu/~wolperj/egpws.html">http://math.isu.edu/~wolperj/egpws.html</a>&gt;.]

The Air Transport Association recently announced [1] that US airlines would
install the Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS).  This presents
a RISK because it is possible to misuse the system.  Similar misuse of the
Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) presents less of a RISK and has
been a factor in increasing efficiency of commercial air operations.  (Other
risks from TCAS are described in previous RISKS; [2].)

The EGPWS manufactured by Allied Signal is described in [3].  The essence of
its operation is a terrain database.  In the air, the EGPWS compares the
aircraft's position and velocity with the terrain database to predict
potential terrain impact, and a cockpit display is provided.  The aircraft's
position may be determined by Global Position System inputs (GPS) or, what
is more likely for now, Flight Management System (FMS) inputs.  See [6] for
a rather technical description of the FMS on the B-737.  To quote from that
source: "If radio updating is not available, the error can be very
significant."

Two authors ([4],[5]) have already mentioned EGPWS in relation to assessing
other aviation risks; but the risk identified here is, I believe, new.

It is axiomatic that when people are given a new tool they will manage to
use it in unanticipated ways.  This has been the case with TCAS, and one has
to assume that it will be the case with EGPWS.  TCAS allows pilots to "see"
other aircraft and arrange proper spacing without controller intervention.
Some of this use is unauthorized and based on rules-of-thumb developed by
pilots.

Pilots will inevitably develop rules-of-thumb on how to get the most out of
EGPWS.  Most of this information will be appropriate and useful.  This is
not the case, however, if these rules-of-thumb include how to use EGPWS
alone to stay away from high terrain, because there is an important
difference between using EGPWS for separation from terrain and using TCAS
for separation from other aircraft.  In the TCAS case, the "database", as it
were, is subject to continual real time updating: with each sweep of the
radar antenna, each aircraft's transponder sends out an update.
Furthermore, the information derived from the transponder replies is
relative: aircraft A is 5 miles east of aircraft B.  If there is any
statistical bias in this calculation, the bias applies equally to all
participants.

EGPWS does not update the database: the terrain sits there and the airplane
flies towards it.  The cockpit display is based on the unit's estimate of the
aircraft position, and any statistical bias in calculating that position
estimate is translated directly into error in the cockpit display.  The
display may show the aircraft to be 5 miles from high terrain, but if there
is a 5 mile error in the unit's position, the consequences could be dire.

Such behavior is unlikely with the present GPWS, because its operation
cannot be sensed unless a warning situation develops; in this case, there is
an audible warning "Pull Up!  Terrain!"  EGPWS gives the pilot a map-like
display of the terrain surrounding the calculated position of the aircraft,
so is available even when not issuing a warning.

It is very unlikely that a crew from a major airline would misuse EGPWS in
this way.  Let me paint a more realistic scenario.  Imagine the crew of a
regional airliner or charter aircraft making a night approach to a mountain
airport, such as Hailey, ID, which serves the Sun Valley ski resort.  There
is no valid public instrument approach into Hailey at night, but if the
prevailing visibility at the airport is 3 miles or more pilots may legally
make an approach under Visual Flight Rules (VFR).  The airport is surrounded
by mountains, and, as a ski resort, is subject to frequent snow showers.  In
this situation, a pilot with inadequate training might be tempted to use
EGPWS in order to complete a VFR approach, rather than abandoning the
approach and flying to a different airport.  In the dark, even with
unlimited visibility, the mountains may be unseen.  An error in the EGPWS
equipment's position estimate could lead to a disaster.

The crew may be misled by the perceived "accuracy" of the computer display
into believing that maneuvering the aircraft away from the mountains
depicted on the EGPWS display will ensure terrain separation.  It looks like
a map; it feels like a map; it must be a map!  After all, pilots are no more
computer literate than the population at large.  I teach Computer Science at
the university and flying at the airport, and there is no overlap between
these student populations.

Pilots flying with EGPWS equipment must be made aware of its limitations, as
they are made aware of the limitations of all on-board equipment.
Instructors may want to consider a two-step scenario (presented in the full
length version of this essay) which illustrates the dangers of this failure
mode.

There are many proposals for advanced avionics systems which would give
pilots an "out the window" picture of the world, even in instrument or night
conditions, with a "highway in the sky" depiction of the aircraft's intended
route of flight.  The current EGPWS is the first deployed system of this
type.  Designers of future enhancements must pay careful attention to
possible failure modes (e.g., map shift), and those who train pilots to use
such systems must ensure that pilots understand the system's limitations.

There is a potential security problem with the way Windows 95 resolves
shortcuts that may be of interest to comp.risks readers.  If you have
Windows 95, are networked, have ever renamed your computer, and have sharing
enabled you may be at risk.  The risk happens if you are sharing your C
drive itself and another machine on your network decides to use your prior
name, then shares their C drive.  The problem happens due to the way Windows
95 resolves shortcuts (links).  In the above situation both the UNC and
local path are stored in the shortcuts when they are created.  That is, when
you rename your computer none of the UNC names in your shortcuts are
renamed! If at a future time someone else uses your old hostname and share
then something interesting happens to your shortcuts.  1) They will either
FAIL to run at all if a password to the remote UNC can not be supplied!, or
2) will SILENTLY connect to the remote UNC if no password was set! Keep in
mind windows will suggest a default share name, so when sharing your C drive
it will be called C unless changed.  A given UNC would look like
  c:\\hostname\c filename .
More detail outlining what you can NOT do about this can be found by
reading Microsoft knowledge base article q150215
(<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q150/2/15.asp">http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q150/2/15.asp</a>). This
article reports that ``This behavior is by design.''!!!
You can run the shortcuts command they suggest but it will not REMOVE the
old UNC information, rather it will just ignore it.  Note: you have to do
this for every link on your system on at at time.  The command does not
allow full paths so it must be done within each directory on the
system. Furthermore the command has no way of dumping all of the UNC paths
in the link however if you have a binary viewer you can see them.

<pre>
Greg Rose mentions the implementation of critical sections using process
priority on a PDP-11 in early Unix.  Actually, no.  Priority inversion was
not an issue here; correctness of the code is.

In multilevel interrupt priority systems, one standard programming
technique is to associate a priority level with any particular piece of data
that may potentially be shared between interrupt and non-interrupt code.  In
order to access that piece of data, code must ensure that the process is at
that interrupt level.  (The processor will only accept interrupts whose
priority is at least as high as the current processor level, and will raise
the processor's level to match the interrupt's level before executing the
appropriate handler.)

This protocol is safe, but requires a bit of reasoning, and an additional
assumption.

Let's start by assuming processes may not change the processors priority;
only the interrupt mechanism does so.  Consider code accessing an object
whose minimum access priority is Pa.  The processor is thus currently
running at priority Pa as well.  It can only lose the process to a process
with priority Pn &gt; Pa, which can't access objects at priority Pa; so this
code's actions can't be interrupted.  Further, when this code began
execution, it did so by hypotheses as the result of an interrupt at priority
Pa.  Thus, the processor must previously have been running at priority
Po &lt; Pa.  The code at priority Po couldn't have been accessing the object
either.  So access to the object is safe.

Not allowing processes to change their priority is safe, but too
restrictive, as it makes it impossible to communicate between priority
levels!  Note that it's always safe to *raise* the processor priority level:
This can't affect what other processes the code might have interrupted, and
can only exclude more possible interrupts.  Further, after raising the
priority, it's certainly safe to lower it back to where it was, since that
was known to be safe.

On the other hand, lowering the priority level *below the entry level* is
deadly.  Consider the following: P3 is running a priority 3, accessing an
object designated as level 3.  P4 gains control at priority level 4, and
drops the priority level to 2.  A new priority 3 interrupt comes in,
starting a new process at priority level 3 — which accesses the same object
as P3.  P3's critical section has been violated.  (Dropping the priority
level by exactly 1 below your entry level avoids this, but doesn't buy you
anything, since you must not touch any object "owned" by that level: *You*
might have interrupted someone running at that level who was accessing the
object.)

Finally, it's clear that if you raise your priority level from Po to Pn, you
can't possibly be interrupting any code of priority Po+1 ... Pn, and you are
already in a logical critical section for objects of priority Po; so you may
safely access any object with a level between Po and Pn inclusive.

Putting this all together, a safe set of rules is: Every object has an
associated priority level.  Every process has an associated "entry priority
level" Pe, set by the interrupt that started it.  (User-level code has
Pe=0).  A process at my raise its priority level Pc, and may lower it, but
not below Pe.  While at Pc, it may access any object with associated level
Po as long as Pe &lt;= Po &lt;= Pc.

Priority inversion is impossible here: There is no waiting, except for the
processor priority level to drop low enough for an interrupt to be
delivered.  (Alternatively, you can think of Po as the priority of a monitor
associated with the object.  "Priority inheritance" is enforced implicitly,
since you have to "inherit" the priority before you are even allowed into
the monitor.  Curious, in all the years I taught about this algorithm in OS
classes, I never thought of this analogy before.)

The degenerate case has only two levels, "user" and interrupt.  You get
exactly the usual rules and behavior for simple critical sections.

DEC operating systems PDP-11's (at least RSX; probably others) used this
style of locking before Unix was developed.  (The hardware was designed the
way it was exactly to allow this style of synchronization.)  Unix, for the
most part, deliberately used a degenerate form, in which "raise to priority
level" was almost always taken to mean "raise it to the maximum".  Most Unix
device drivers raise the level on entry.  In effect, this gives you one big
mutex around the entire kernel, rather than monitors around various objects.
This approach is simpler, works fine for time-sharing systems (the advantage
of doing things at a finer grain is decreased interrupt latency, which is
more on a issue for real-time kinds of systems) — and, most important, is
the only approach that was portable to the wide variety of hardware
available in the late '70's and '80's that didn't necessarily support
multilevel interrupts.

VMS also uses the same synchronization scheme, though it was long ago
extended to support multiprocessors.  (Since priority levels don't work for
synchronization across processors, in-memory mutexes have to be used.
However, a priority level is associated with each such mutex.  To attempt to
lock a mutex, you must first be sure your own processor is at the mutex's
priority level, or higher.  This limits the contention on the locks to the
highest priority thread from each processor.)

BTW, you may wonder: Since a process may never lower its priority below its
entry level, how can it communicate "downward" — e.g., how can a driver's
interrupt code write into a status variable accessible from user level?
That's what the software interrupt mechanism is for: If code at priority Pc
needs to do something at priority Pn &lt; Pc, it requests a software interrupt
at Pn.  That interrupt will be queued until the code at Pc, and any other
higher-level interrupts, complete.  Then an interrupt at Pn takes place,
and the interrupt routine — known as a "fork routine" in DEC parlance" --
will be able to access the appropriate objects.

[FORWARDED, with ellipsis:] Probably of very minority interest, but there's
still a few of them out there (estimated about 6000 with the affected
equipment in the UK, I'm told): PDP-11s (I think -83s or similar) fitted
with a particular clock board (made in Germany; I don't know the
manufacturer) are exhibiting a nasty Y2K bug. To quote my contact:

We supplied a pdp11 to [...]  recently and when they tried it out they said
it had a year 2000 compliance problem.  Turns out it's a bit more (or less)
than that.  Put the system date to 2000: no problem.  Put the date to 29 Feb
2000 and bang!  It gets really confused and jumps back to 1900 [...]  This
bug is only manifest on -11s fitted with that clock card.

I just got a flyer for a program that will help companies with PC's that
have old BIOSes that won't deal with Y2K. But the advice it gives is to
experiment by setting the clock to 12/31/1999 23:59 (or 2/28/2000 23:59 for
a leap-year bug).  I presume long-time risks readers are aware of the
problems with setting the clock forward and triggering many programs to

%T   "Technology and Privacy: The New Landscape"

Agre, perhaps most widely known for the Red Rock Eater news service, and
Rotenberg, Director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, go to some
lengths to define what this book is not.  It is not a fundamental analysis
of privacy.  It is not an investigative work.  It does not address specific
areas of concern.  It is not a systematic comparison.  It does not cover the
broadest interpretation of technology.  It does not provide a general theory
of privacy, nor detailed policy proposals.  It is an overview of policy and
thought regarding the impact of information and communications technologies
on privacy over the last two decades.

Working in the field of data security I am quite used to dealing with
subjects that have barely brushed the public consciousness.  Privacy is one
such area, as evidenced by the lack of agreement even on such a basic issue
as a definition of privacy.  I must admit, however, that the essays in this
volume surprised me with the extent of the work in privacy policy and
regulations that have gone on in ... well, private, without making much
impact in either the media or public discussion as a whole.  Although
academic in tone, the content of the papers is compelling enough to hold the
interest of almost any audience.  The text is informed, and while the
quality of writing may vary it is always clear and matter of fact.  Topics
covered include the representational nature of data-oriented computing (and
the trend towards "virtual worlds"), privacy design considerations in
multimedia computing, privacy policy harmonization on an international
scale, privacy enhancing technologies, social pressures on privacy, privacy
law and developing policy, cryptography, and design considerations for large
scale projects.

(In any anthology the tone and value of individual pieces varies.  In this
current work the level of consistency and quality is high.  The one
startling and disappointing exception is the essay by David Flaherty,
Information and Privacy Commissioner for British Columbia.  It might
possibly be intended as an examination of a "real life" example of such an
office.  In its current state, however, it reads more like a long and
unconvincing advertisement for a book by one David Flaherty, and the working
tribulations of one David Flaherty.  The whining tone and constant criticism
of everyone else involved in his work makes it particularly unattractive.
This paper is also least focussed on the topic, dealing with technology only
in a minor way.)

For all the general discussion about technology and privacy, it is obvious
that few people are informed as to the realities of the topic.  This book is
recommended as a readable, informative, and important contribution to the
literature.
