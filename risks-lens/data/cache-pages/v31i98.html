Nick Corasaniti and Stephanie Saul,
In Georgia Election Havoc, a Costly Bet on Tech Led to Meltdown
<em>The New York Times</em> front page and page A16, 12 Jun 2020
</p>
<p>
“As Georgia election officials prepared to roll out an over-$100M high-tech
voting system last year, good-government groups, a federal judge and
election security experts warned of its perils.  The new system, they
argued, was too convoluted, too expensive, too big—and was still
insecure.”
</p>
<p>
  “The problem seems to have been a perfect storm (overused metaphor, but
     apt here) of new equipment, hasty training and a crush of tasks
     associated with both getting the mail ballots out the door and
     processed AND with running an in-person voting operation.”
    (Charles Stewart III)</p>
<p>
  “A lot of people saw this coming … There are a lot more things that can
     go wrong.”  (Andrew Appel)</p>
<p>
  “A Rube Goldberg contraption” (Marilyn Marks)
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Power demands blew fuses in aging polling places.
</li>
<li>Some equipment never could power up.
</li>
<li>Inability to boot equipment [once powered up].
</li>
<li>PIN authorizations, physical cards.
</li>
<li>Technicians who never explained the problems they fixed (on the fly).
</li>
<li>In one location, only four poll workers instead of 12.
</li>
<li>Inadequate training.
</li>
<li>Dominion staff had to “replace only 20 components” among 30,000 machines
  considered a success story!
</li>
<li>Dominion's Democracy 5.5 system used in this election had failed
  certification in Texas last year.
</li>
<li>The computerized ballot-marking systems in other states were known
  to cause problems in other states, due to user error, poor training,
  infrastructure challenges, and “the occasional software issue”.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is just one more fiasco in a year already marked by fiascos.
November does not augur well.
</p>
<p>
This election might remind RISKS readers of Murphy's Law.  However,
in this case</p>
<blockquote>
  “Anything that can go wrong will go wrong.”</blockquote>
<p>
might be recast as</p>
<blockquote>
  “Everything that can go wrong did go wrong.”
</blockquote>
<p>
So, asks a long-time RISKS reader,</p>
<blockquote>
  “What's wrong with hand-marked paper ballots?”

Gaurav Agrawal, a scientist and amateur photographer living in San Diego,
couldn't believe it when he suddenly started seeing a photograph he took
last summer popping up on the news.  He took it at St Mary Lake in Glacier
National Park, Montana, one “magical evening” in August 2019.  He shared the
snap on photo platform Flickr and thought no more about it.
</p>
<p>
However, a glitch meant that when the image was set as wallpaper, it caused
some Android phones to fail.  The handsets would switch on and off
repeatedly, requiring a factory reset which meant all data on them was
wiped.

There was once a little mouse that caused a big problem.
</p>
<p>
The critter crawled up in the wheel well of a parked car, made his way over
the brakes and up into the engine. Most rodents would stop there, it's a
nice nesting spot. But this fella had other plans.
</p>
<p>
He kept going until he was inside the dashboard and couldn't get out.
There, he died (I didn't say it would be a happy story). The rancid and
revolting odor compelled the car owner to bring it to Avis Ford in
Southfield, where service technicians made the unsavory discovery.
</p>
<p>
“Usually you find a wiring harness for the engine or the fuel injection
system that is all chewed up,” said Avis Ford's Service Manager Larry
Sirgany. “We'll find a car that's been sitting for a couple weeks and it
will have a big nasty nest in there too.”
</p>
<p>
Over the years, Sirgany has found plenty of flora and fauna in car engines.
There are grass and twig nests and dead—sometimes alive—vermin and
lots of chewed wires. The resulting damage is costly to fix.
</p>
<p>
But this spring, amid the stay home order during the coronavirus pandemic,
the rodent ruination to engines has been exceptionally high in some places.
</p>
<p>
“I've seen a solid dozen to 15 cars with damage in the last six weeks,”
Sirgany said. “Typically, I would have two per month this time of year.”
</p>
<p>
<em>Hundreds in repairs</em> […]

Just like with foods that display health information the package,
researchers are exploring a tool that details how connected devices manage
data.
</p>
<p>
The Internet-of-things security crisis has been building for more than a
decade, with unprotected, unpatchable gadgets fueling botnets, getting
attacked for nation state surveillance, and just generally being a weak link
for networks. Given that IoT security seems unlikely to magically improve
anytime soon, researchers and regulators are rallying behind a new approach
to managing IoT risk. Think of it as nutrition labels for embedded devices.

The new tools are meant to help the developers of password managers and
Apple hopes the tools will reduce the instances where users chose their own
password rather than rely on the password manager.

<p>
<em>This year has brought immense change, much of it immortalized in
high-resolution images from space.</em>
</p>
<p>
As protesters gathered in Washington over the weekend, their march across
the city was documented by photography satellites flying overhead. One
particular image stood out and made its way to various television
newscasts. It showed the the bright yellow <em>Black Lives Matter</em> mural that
had been painted on two blocks of asphalt near the White House. It was
visual proof that the protests and their message had, in a sense, made their
way to space.
</p>
<p>
The company that took the photo, Planet Labs Inc., has hundreds of
satellites floating around Earth, enough that it can snap at least one photo
of every spot on the planet every day, according to the startup. Such
imagery used to be rare, expensive and controlled by governments. Now,
Planet has built what amounts to a real-time accounting system of the earth
that just about anyone can access by paying a fee.
</p>
<p>
Over the next couple months, Planet is embarking on a project that will
dramatically increase the number of photos it takes and improve the quality
of the images by 25% in terms of resolution.  To do that, the company is
lowering the orbits of some of its larger, high-resolution satellites and
launching a half-dozen more devices. As a result, Planet will go from
photographing locations twice a day to as many as 12 times a day in some
places.
</p>
<p>
Customers will also be able to aim the satellites where they want using an
automated system developed by Planet. “The schedule is shipped to the
satellite, and it knows the plan it needs to follow,” said Jim Thomason,
the vice president of products at Planet.
</p>
<p>
Advancements like this in satellite imaging would have seemed unbelievable
to the folks who started working on such research in earnest in the 1960s.
Back then, the U.S. had a top-secret operation that entailed putting
satellites into orbit, snapping pictures and then ejecting canisters of film
from the satellites that tumbled back to Earth to be caught midair by a
plane. Analysts would then develop the film and pore over the images looking
for Soviet missile sites and other military operations. This Rube
Goldbergian process didn't always work well, but it did ultimately result in
the U.S. learning that the Russian missile program was not as advanced as
officials had feared.  […]

<p>
Multiple US federal agencies have obtained a mysterious new eavesdropping
device thought to be designed to monitor 4G-enabled mobile phones.
</p>
<p>
Very little is known about the <em>Crossbow</em> device, other than it iterates on
the Stingray ISMI-catchers manufactured by Harris, used to trace location
data and listen in on phone calls.

</p>
<p>
While devices of this kind are used by law enforcement and intelligence
across the globe, the air of mystery around the kit and a lack of
transparency over the way in which it is being deployed has given rise to
concern it could be used to infringe upon civil liberties.

</p>
<p>
BRUSSELS—A key protocol for Internet traffic is riddled with
vulnerabilities that pose risks to telecom operators, including the
potential to bring down websites and allow fraudsters to set up fake
traffic, a telecom security firm said Wednesday.
</p>
<p>
The protocol “contains a number of vulnerabilities threatening both mobile
operators and their clients. As a result, attackers can interfere with
network equipment and leave an entire city without communications,
impersonate users to access various resources, and use network services at
the expense of the operator or subscribers,” Positive Technologies said in
a new report.
&lt;<a href="https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/POLITICO-Positive-Technologies-report-Threat-vector-GTP-June-2020.pdf">https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/POLITICO-Positive-Technologies-report-Threat-vector-GTP-June-2020.pdf</a>&gt;
</p>
<p>
The widespread GTP protocol is used across the board by telecom companies
and Internet service providers to manage Internet traffic. It is also used
in core parts of Internet networks, meaning the vulnerabilities are likely
to persist in coming years as operators build new 5G infrastructure that
still relies on 4G core networks.
</p>
<p>
“It's not like vulnerabilities in software. In the case of GTP, it is a
kind of architectural deficiency. It's harder to eliminate,” said Dmitry
Kurbatov, chief technology officer at Positive Technologies. The firm
performed security tests on dozens of networks in 2018-2019 and found
“every network tested was vulnerable” to exploits through the protocol.
</p>
<p>
The vulnerabilities can be used to target servers with denial-of-service
attacks, allow hackers to set up so-called man-in-the-middle attacks that
trick people into thinking they are visiting legitimate websites, and even
allow operators to send fraudulent traffic to other operators, Kurbatov
said.

<p>
The FBI on Wednesday warned that malicious cyber actors were targeting
mobile banking apps in an attempt to steal money as more Americans have
moved to online banking during the coronavirus pandemic.
</p>
<p>
In a public service announcement, the FBI noted it expects to see hackers
exploit mobile banking platforms, which have seen a 50 percent surge in use
since the beginning of the pandemic.
&lt;<a href="https://www.ic3.gov/media/2020/200610.aspx">https://www.ic3.gov/media/2020/200610.aspx</a>&gt;
</p>
<p>
“With city, state, and local governments urging or mandating social
distancing, Americans have become more willing to use mobile banking as an
alternative to physically visiting branch locations.  The FBI expects cyber
actors to attempt to exploit new mobile banking customers using a variety of
techniques, including app-based banking trojans and fake banking apps.”
</p>
<p>
The FBI specifically pointed to threat of banking trojans, which involve a
malicious virus hiding on a user's mobile device until a legitimate banking
app is downloaded. Once the real app is on the device, the banking trojan
then overlays the app, tricking the user into clicking on it and inputting
their banking login credentials.
</p>
<p>
Fake banking apps were also cited as a threat, with users in danger of
being tricked into downloading malicious apps that also steal sensitive
banking information.
</p>
<p>
In order to combat these threats, the FBI recommended that Americans only
download banking apps from official app stores or from banking websites and
that banking app users enable two-factor authentication on their accounts
and use strong passwords.  […]

The research institute was created to steer AI away from harmful uses.  Now
it's competing with tech giants to sell a cloud-computing service to
businesses.
</p>
<p>
Last spring, artificial intelligence research institute OpenAI said it had
made software so good at generating text”including fake news articles —
that it was too dangerous to release. That line in the sand was soon erased
when two recent master's grads recreated the software and OpenAI released
the original, saying awareness of the risks had grown and it hadn't seen
evidence of misuse.
</p>
<p>
Now the lab is back with a more powerful text generator and a new pitch: Pay
us to put it to work in your business. Thursday, OpenAI launched a cloud
service that a handful of companies are already using to improve search or
provide feedback on answers to math problems. It's a test of a new way of
programming AI and the lab's unusual business model.

<em>Chinese dissidents in US targeted after announcing plans for video call
commemorating 1989 massacre</em>
</p>
<p>
Zoom disabled the accounts of a group of Chinese dissidents in the US after
they used its video conference service to commemorate the Tiananmen Square
massacre.
</p>
<p>
Zoom's role in shutting down the meeting, which was hosted and organised by
activists in the US but included participants dialing in from China, will
increase fears about the platform's security and how it will respond to
government censorship requests.
</p>
<p>
Zoom's video chat service has exploded in popularity since lockdowns were
introduced across the globe to slow the spread of Covid-19. The company,
which is listed on Nasdaq, has a large operation in China: almost a third
of its workers are based in the country and much of its research and
development takes place there. It also has servers in China.
</p>
<p>
The annual Tiananmen Square commemoration was hosted on Zoom by a group of
Chinese activists in the US, including Wang Dan, one of the most prominent
leaders of the pro-democracy student movement that was crushed by the
Chinese army in Beijing on June 4 1989.
</p>
<p>
Mr Wang's team shared screenshots with the <em>Financial Times</em> of his Zoom
call being canceled twice and two of his team's paid Zoom accounts being
disabled. The cancellations started just as the meetings were due to begin
on the morning of June 4 in Washington, where Mr Wang is based. He added
that as of Thursday, the accounts remained disabled. […]

Security screens are inconvenient; they slow consumer foot traffic to
benefit public safety.
</p>
<p>
Enter real-time AI to assess the shape and density of concealed objects in
high-foot traffic areas (transportation terminals, entertainment venues,
office doorways). Potted plants frequently conceal metal and temperature
detectors. Some detectors apply passive (non-ionizing) radiation to resolve
features.

Significant, possibly panoptic, auto-profile ingress/egress go/no-go
processing can promote complacency among security personnel, and raise alarm
fatigue risk. Reducing human security footprint (aka business operational
expense) is apparently a key motive fueling the business.

Surveillance-enabling technologies seek to displace Barney beagle and other

<p>
President Trump finally issued an *Executive Order targeting viewpoint
discrimination by Big Tech social media companies. The Order grows out of
Trump's summit on this thorny issue last July. Topping the list of targets
are Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube and Google, but there are many
other possibilities.
</p>
<p>
This form of discrimination is very much uncharted legal territory. The
chosen central concept for Big Tech wrongdoing is censorship, as the EO is
titled <em>Executive Order on Preventing Online Censorship</em>. This choice in
itself is a strategic legal decision.
</p>
<p>
The Order is basically a hunting license for federal agencies. There are
two distinct parts. The first is basically laying out a number of legal
arguments. If you are not familiar with the legal issues this may seem like
empty rhetoric, but it is actually the opposite. The lawyers who wrote this
order are preparing to stand before a judge.
</p>
<p>
In fact the Order begins by focusing on the present law, which protects Big
Tech from liability when they publish someone else's content. Here is the
opening paragraph on that legal issue. Note that it is presented as a
Federal policy.  […]
