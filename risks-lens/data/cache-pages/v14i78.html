  Norwalk, Conn. (AP) — A day after its owner admitted cheating the
  government out of $6.7 million in taxes, Stew Leonard's dairy and produce
  store was accused Friday of mislabeling weights on hundreds of items.

It seems that almost half of 2,658 tested products were short-weighted or had
no weight listed on the label.  As for the tax fraud, the criminals apparently
removed records of $17.1 million in sales figures "in a computer-aided tax
fraud scheme."  The data diddling meant they failed to pay $6.7 million in
taxes. The penalty is that they must pay $15 million in back taxes and fines.

Would someone from that area of the country please post additional details
on how the computer scam operated?

Lopez Said To Order GM Papers; Volkswagen Denies Receiving Documents
Washington Post, 23 July 1993
By Frank Swoboda and Rick Atkinson, Washington Post Staff Writers

  Secret General Motors documents seized recently at a Wiesbaden apartment
  by German investigators were prepared at the request of former GM executive
  Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua before he joined rival Volkswagen, German
  prosecutors said yesterday.

The article goes on to explain that the documents included information about
Opel (General Motors in Europe) new Vectra car and about a top-secret "O" car.
Both Lopez and VW deny any impropriety and denounced the prosecutor's public
announcement.  An intensive search of VW's computer systems is apparently
going on to see if GM proprietary data have been stored there.

There was a recent article about the US trying to buy back Stinger
antiaircraft missiles before they got sold to others.

This sounds like another version of the stories about government
installations being rather lax about complying with pollution control
requirements. Similarly, security considerations should include a time limit
on small powerful weapons. I presume that worry about the future is not a
checklist item. Does anyone on this list know more about the issues involved?

BEIJING (UPI, July 23, 1993) — [PGN Excerpting Service]

A Chinese Northwest Airlines flight carrying 113 people bounced off the runway
and plunged into a lake in Yinchuan, the capital of Ningxia province, in a
remote part of west China, on 23 Jul 1993, killing 59 people.  The airliner
attempted two takeoffs.  The first was aborted.  On the second, it ran off the
runway, dropped into a lake, and broke apart.  Flight 2119, a British
Aerospace 146, was on a scheduled flight to Beijing.  Ian Watson, director of
regional operations for British Aerospace, said that "In the 10 years since it
came into service, the BA-146 has compiled one of the finest safety records in
the world."

The last major airline disaster in China occurred in November when a China
Southern Airlines Boeing 737 crashed into a mountain in the south China
tourist city of Guilin, killing all 141 aboard.  China has halted the
establishment of new airline companies to improve air safety and tighten
control over expansion in civil aviation.  About 35 airline companies have
sprouted up in China since CAAC relinquished control over the industry in
1988, faster growth than in any other country.

China has only 109 airports, a fraction of those in developed countries, but
passenger volume rose more than 24 percent in the first half of this year over
last year.

<i>Mon, 26 Jul 93 12:55 CDT</i>
<pre>
An unusual (and probably unexpected) risk has appeared — business card
vending machines.  I saw my first one at a service plaza on the Indiana Toll
Road (I-80/90).  Basically, it's a simplified desktop publisher that will
print out a variety of business card formats; you just enter your information.
The prices were, of course, outrageous — whereas I paid something less than 2
cents/card last time I had some printed professionally, this was at least 10
times that, even in quantity.  Well, I suppose that a traveling salesman in an
emergency ....

Anyway, the risk comes in here: the instructions suggest that you first
purchase a small number of cards to be sure they print correctly; you can
later put in more money and print out a larger quantity if you like what you
see.  Then this: "The machine stores your information for several minutes."

So, presumably, one could walk away from one of these machines with your cards
reading "John Smith, Computer Consultant, 10 Takeita Way, Suckerstown, MD" and
return from your business trip to find your house burgled of everything
resembling a computer ... simply because someone went up to the machine after
you left and printed out a set of their own.  Or a woman could give away,
unwittingly, her otherwise unlisted home phone number to a deep breather.  And
so on.

Again, as with so many of the risks discussed here, there is a debatable
amount of privacy invasion on what is basically public information ...  but
information that is given to people you would otherwise NOT want to have it.

Postscript: another risk was illustrated here — a sample "business card"
inscribed with a semiliterate harangue along the lines of "You shouldn't park
here, your license plate has been recorded by an anal-retentive mentally
unstable person, and if you park here again a pickup truck with no insurance
will wipe it back and forth along that nearby concrete wall."  More or less
identical in demeanor to the mail one gets for mis-posting.  Three times as
long, of course, and partly CAPITALIZED in TIME-HONORED Usenet NEWBIE style.
Yet I believe that such a card, slipped under someone's wiper, would
constitute legal assault.  (IANAL.)  And these people are *advocating* this?
Yikes.

<i>Wed, 21 Jul 93 21:17 PDT</i>
<pre>
Living here in the L.A. area, where earthquakes are certainly more than an
academic concern, I can't help but question the usefulness of a warning system
that gives, perhaps, 15 to 30 seconds of panic time.  And I do mean panic
time--because that's what most people would do.  Primarily, most folks would
probably try to rush out of buildings (just like they do when quakes start,
even though they should know better).  Lots of them will get out the door just
in time to get hit by falling debris when the quake hits, which they could
have avoided if they had just stayed inside.

That's all assuming that the quake *does* hit.  If the alarm is false, you
can bet that the *next* time the alarm fires it will be generally
ignored--for better or worse.

One can certainly argue that the solution is education and training
and such--but human nature being what it is, you can bet that if people
believe the alarm, most of them are going to do pretty much the wrong
thing in response, especially when the duration in which to act
is very short.  The real effort should go into upgrading of older
buildings that predate modern earthquake area construction standards--
it's with those buildings that most injuries and deaths are likely
to occur.

I'm reminded of an old "Saturday Night Live" skit.  It was a fake
commercial for a device passengers could carry on planes that would give
them 10 seconds warning (or some such) of midair collisions.  The guy
is sitting calmly in his seat when the box starts beeping.  He grabs
it and stares at its display.  He yells:

"We're going to be hit by a 747!  (SCREAM!)"

&gt;The most damaging waves will arrive no earlier than an average
&gt;velocity of 4.5 km/s.  This would appear to give 45 seconds warning at 100 km.

Er, my calculator says this would give 22 seconds warning at 100 km,
which makes the economic feasibility of an early warning system even
worse than stated.  I do hope the quote above is a typical email typo,
and not an accurate extraction from the California study!

(I hope this doesn't sound too much like an advertisement...) Reiter's
Scientific &amp; Professional Books, a great bookstore in Washington, D.C., is now
on the Internet and is accepting credit card orders over the Internet for book
orders. Orders and inquiries can be sent to "books@reiters.com" while comments
can be sent to "rbaker@reiters.com".

I enquired about exactly how they wanted me to give them my credit card
number, and they replied that they actually prefer to set up an account over
the phone with the pertinent information, and then give you an account number.
You then transmit the account number to them via email to place an order. They
did not, however, reject the possibility of conducting business via email
without voice verification.

My suggestion to look into public key encryption went unanswered...

This is further to the ongoing discussion on using credit cards over the
internet. To ensure security and escape the (possibly) prying eyes of
administrators at the sites through which a mail (ordering a product to
be paid through a credit card) passes, the sender could encrypt his/her
request. The key used for encryption could be a special INTERNET PIN that
the credit card company assigns while issuing the card, just like the one
assigned for ATM transactions through the card.

at the receiving end, the dealer simply forwards the mail to the credit
card company and waits for authorization from them. the dealer does not
know the card number since the mail is encrypted.

the credit card company could decrypt the mail, since they know the sender's
name and maybe the ZIP code (of course when the mail is encrypted, this
information should not be) and hence can find out the card number and the
special INTERNET PIN. once they decrypt the mail, they can verify if the
original sender listed the correct card number in his/her mail. once verified,
they can authorize the dealer to accept the request depending on the cost of
the product and the balance on the customer's account.

&gt; (1) Soliciting CC transactions might violate the Acceptable Use

&gt;     internet connection.)

I believe the parenthetical remark is quite incorrect.  Traffic on sponsored
networks must conform to the AUPs, even if it originates on a commercial net.
I know I received a couple of solicitations out of the blue from people who
didn't understand this, and who now know better.

only said an unavoidable royalty "amounted to" a tax) I think he fails to show
that my comparison of NIST/PKP's proposal to a tax is invalid.  Bidzos could
have argued that it was overdrawn, less apt than another analogy, or even
wrong on some concrete grounds.  But his complaints are weak if strident.  And
talk about charging for DSS implementations rather than uses (at least for the
nonce) draws a distinction without a difference.  The U.S. taxes bottles of
liquor, not individual drinks poured at home, but economists will agree that
you pay every time you swallow.  Whether a tax is mills per ton or dollars per
ounce is not the point, anyway.  As for that $1 per certificate... Bidzos says
users won't pay it--I think he's wrong.  Users pay for everything in the end.

Also, the stuff about "free for government use" is smokescreen.  It's private
use that matters, including, especially, private use to communicate with the
government.  I cannot find, even by the closest scrutiny of the NIST/PKP
announcement, any promise to relieve users of royalties on products they use
to communicate with the government.  (Possible loophole: gov't could supply
DSS implementations to users royalty free; but that would depart from custom.)

Location: University of California, Irvine, CA

AN INTRODUCTION TO SOFTWARE SYSTEM SAFETY, Oct. 25-27

  In order to ensure and certify that software will execute without resulting
  in unacceptable risk, changes to normal software development practices are
  necessary.  This tutorial will focus on the unique problems involved in
  building safety-critical software and describe some techniques that can be
  used to enhance the safety of software-controlled systems.  Emphasis will
  be on procedures and techniques that are practical enough to be applied to
  projects today. Real-project experiences with these techniques in different
  application areas will be described.

Topics:

Basic Principles of Risk
    Basic concepts in risk
    Why technological fixes may not reduce risk
    Using past experience to prevent future accidents
    How safe is safe enough?
    Do computers reduce or increase risk?

A TUTORIAL ON SOFTWARE TESTING, Oct. 28-29

The intent of this tutorial is to equip managers, software engineers, and
test engineers with an understanding of testing technology to enable them to
promote software testing in their organizations from an ad hoc, labor
intensive, error-prone activity to a disciplined, technology-supported
process.  Emphasis is on techniques that are practical today.  Some underlying
testing theory will be presented to provide a foundation for evaluating
testing technology, and several new approaches will be discussed.  Issues
of selecting complementary techniques and integrating them to achieve a
comprehensive testing process are also addressed.

Topics:
  Software Testing Principles
    Definitions and basic principles
    Testing concepts
    Psychological factors
    Economic impacts
  Managerial Considerations
