Well, we survived the move to another building (I'm now in EL-243), although
for a variety of reasons the servers could not be moved on schedule and getting
everything working again was decidedly nontrivial.  But the resulting outage of
five days meant that some mail to CSL.SRI.COM was rejected.  So, if you got
BARFmail indicating your mail to CSL was undeliverable, PLEASE TRY AGAIN NOW.
Sorry for the inconvenience.  Peter

<i>Wed, 12 Dec 90 19:30 EDT</i>
<pre>
The New York Times reports (13 Dec 90) that, according to a General Accounting
Office study, as many as 25% of all adjustable rate mortgage bills may
be incorrect as a result of bank errors in calculating their interest
rates. These error were found as part of routine audits done as failed
savings and loan institutions were taken over by Federal regulators.

A former Federal mortgage banking auditor says that that estimate is
too low, putting the problem at 30-35% of adjustable rate mortgages.
In some cases, this auditor says, the errors resulted from "human mistakes" at
small S&amp;Ls, that often calculated adjustable mortgages by hand. In other
cases the problems were caused by "computer glitches." One failed S&amp;L,
the Victor Federal Savings and Loan of Muskogee, Okla, was audited
by the Bennington Group for the Federal Saving and Loan Insurance Corp.
The audit, which sampled 96 adjustable mortgages, found that the
bank's computer system contained logic error. The bank, among other
things, rounded rates upward, instead of downward and "pulled" the
index on the wrong date, when it might be higher or lower than on
the correct date. Other errors resulted from "poor recordkeeping",
where the indices on which the adjustable rates wer based couldn't be found,
or did not match the FSLIC computer programs [which begs an obvious
question]. Some adjustable mortgages have never been adjusted.

In one example given, a woman took out 3 identical adjustable rate mortgages
from the same bank at the same time. Now, all three have wandered off in
different directions. She has 3 different monthly payments, 3 different
balances, and 2 payment schedules.

According to the article, it is the opinion of Federal regulators that the
Truth In Lending Law "probably does not" require lenders to repay overcharges
in any form.

We are back in the world, the little, forgotten, black hole in the East
Midlands is now up and running after over 60 hours of no electricity, often no
water, dodgy phones, and just to finish it off this morning a suspected gas
leak and a heating fault (or at least I presume its a fault its not very
warm!).

Many of the surrounding villages are still without power and in some cases
water and phones.  And all this in the Soar valley with one of the lowest
average snowfalls in England!  The University cedar tree which features on much
of our publicity has lost its top half and I suspect there has been more
arborial damage than in the hurricane year.

For the technically minded the main problem was due to the incredibly wet
sudden snowfall which stuck to anything it touched even in a gale.  The
Loughborough 132KV grid feed wires and gear fell onto a host of lower voltage
feeders causing massive damage to both.  It must have made firework night look
tame.  All our water is pumped by (non backed-up) electric pumps from
Derbyshire and hence the chaos.  There's nothing more irritating than being
told on the radio to boil all the water when you havent any means of heating
it.  Mind you we can see the plumes of vapour from some of the countries
largest power stations on the Trent and that doesnt improve ones temper when
trying to bake potatoes on a log effect, real-flame, gas fire!

I hope you all had a nice week-end.

The following is excerpted from the "Faculty File" column in the
Princeton Alumni Weekly of December 5, 1990:

    In general, [Joel] Cooper [chairman of the psychology department
    at Princeton] has found, females are more subject to computer
    anxiety than males are, and as a result, they perform
    computer-related tasks worse.  But there's an important contextual
    component to these findings:  the performance differential appears
    only when there's someone else in the room with the female who's
    using the computer.  Just the presence of another person-male or
    female, no matter what he or she is doing-seems to be enough to
    generate computer anxiety.  By contrast, when they're alone in a
    room with a computer, females generally show no appreciable
    difference in performance compared to males.

    In the course of this study, Cooper examined a group of
    middle-school children in Princeton...The children were asked to
    solve arithmetic problems on a computer.  In group settings, the
    girls in the class often did worse than the boys, whose
    performance actually improved when other people were around.  In a
    test of university students, Cooper had groups of men and women
    play an adventure game called Zork on a computer; some played with
    other people present, other were alone.  The middle school results
    were replicated.

    ``We tried to get a fix on what the other people in the room had
    to do to provoke the computer anxiety,'' Cooper recalls.  ``It
    turned out to be almost nothing.  They could be writing a letter
    in the corner, totally ignoring the woman at the keyboard, but
    still her performance would drop.  They just had to be there.''

Mercury News - 90-Dec-12

Compuserve has introduced the FIRST computerized national phone book, listing
the name, address, ZIP, and phone number of 80 million households in the US who
have a listed number.  As of December 1, the Phonefile service allows the
725,000 Compuserve subscribers to search the phone lists of the USA by:

    name &amp; address  - for updating your christmas card list or
              for telemarketing reasons.  This is
              just a computerized version of the
              current phone book - but without needing
              hundreds of phone books for the whole USA.

    name &amp; state    - to find long-lost relatives or to find
              someone who has relocated (out of state).
              Examples include old classmates for class
              reunions, and birth parents of adoptees.

    phone number    - like a "reverse" directory, where you can
              get any listed name &amp; address just by
              looking up the phone number.

The cost of retrieving the information is 25 cents per minute in
addition to Compuserve's standard on-line charge of $12.80 per hour
(21 cents per minute).  The cost is considered not much more than
a call to directory assistance, and can be even cheaper considering
the aquiring and search costs of all the phone books for the USA.

The Phonefile database is compiled by a direct marketing company, Metro Mail
Corp. of Illinois, from phone directories, computerized real estate
transactions, and other sources.  It was not speculated on what the "other"
sources might be, but I would suspect other telemarketing databases, magazine
subscriptions, credit services, Usenet email alias lists :^}) , and other
public sources of name/address information.

A Bellcore New Jersey privacy issues expert, James E. Katz, indicated that a
likely consequence of the directory will be an even greater increase in the
number of unlisted phone numbers in the United States.  It was noted that Japan
and European countries have practically no unlisted numbers, while the United
States runs about 25% of its phone number unlisted, with 33% of California
numbers unlisted.

While Compuserve assures that the directory was designed to discourage the
compilation of marketing lists for junk mail and telemarketing, privacy experts
assume that such use is inevitable.  A magazine for instance, could compile
phone numbers for a telemarketing campaign targeted at reader's whose
subscriptions have lapsed.

<i>Wed, 12 Dec 90 09:44:29 -0800</i>
<pre>
If you don't want to be listed in the "Household Marketplace" database but you
don't have enough energy to write a letter, you can also do the following:

    Dial    1-800-343-5414
    press 3, then 2  (I don't know what to do if you don't have a
            touch-tone phone.)

This will get you a human who will want to send you information about
"Household Marketplace."  However, you can also say that you want to
be removed from the database.  You will then be given the choice of mailing
to Lotus or you can tell them your name and address and they say they will
remove you from the database and send you written confirmation.   I did this
yesterday, so I know they will take your name and address.  I can't vouch that
they send the confirmation, the U.S. Mail isn't that fast.

If you are energetically opposed to this product, here are some names
and addresses you might want to have for your own database:
    Lotus Development Corp.
    55 Cambridge Pkwy.
    Cambridge, MA 02142
    (Mary Ann Malloy Coffey, Marketing Programs Manager)
    (Jim P. Manzi, Chairman, President, and CEO)

    Equifax, Inc.

    Atlanta, GA 30309
    (Jeff V. White, Chairman of the Board)

Someone told me that they phoned Lotus today about getting off the Marketplace
Household database and were told something different than I was told yesterday.
Apparently, today's story is that if you want written confirmation that you've
been removed from the database, you have to send mail to:
    Lotus Development Corp.
    Attn: Marketplace Name Removal
    55 Cambridge Pkwy.
    Cambridge, MA 02142

If you just phone them, they now say they won't send written confirmation.
I wonder what they'll say tomorrow.                                   /tdn

I'll suggest a third reason [for the problems Pete Mellor discussed in modern
weapons system development], that I like to call Model Railroading.  Designing
a complex electronic system to solve some warfare problem is interesting,
challenging, and fun; and somebody else is paying the bills.  As long as we're
not in a war, as long as the system doesn't have to solve some real problem, it
is a delightful toy; and as with a model railroad we get to keep arranging the
scenery so it appears to be doing the Real Thing.
