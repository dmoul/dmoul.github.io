The Washington Post printed a full page of old stock prices one day last
week in their business section.  According to their explanation, the data is
normally stored in a file named "ap stox 2".  In preparing the erroneous
page, a user saw "ap stox2" (i.e. no space) "elsewhere in the machine" and
used it instead.

The article also says that "Steps have been taken to prevent a recurrence".
I wonder what kind of steps?  Educating users?  Probably the most useful
thing to do would be to have the date in the filename, so an old file could
not be mistaken for current data.

The Associated Press newswire for 94.12.26 @ 02:43 EST (via CompuServe's
Executive News Service) reports a case of failed identification and
authentication:

    Sting Backfires.

    MIAMI (AP) â€” FBI agents thought they were setting a trap
    by buying copies of 35 Medicare cards and selling them to
    a suspected fraud operation.

    But now the cards are being used to buy expensive leg braces
    and other medical equipment â€” and the FBI can't track them.

    "The FBI lost control of the cards. Now they have a monster
    on their hands," a government investigator familiar with the
    case told The Miami Herald for a story in Sunday's issues.

According to the story, Medicare spokesperson "Faye Baggiano, associate
administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration in
Washington," admits that they have used the social insurance number as the
Medicare identifier; therefore "Medicare says it can't cancel the copied cards,
which have been circulating for 16 months, because that would wipe out
legitimate federal benefits to the people whose names are on those cards."

Normally, Medicare "provides phony numbers that can be canceled; it is unclear
why the FBI used real numbers.

An analysis of just 10 of the 35 stolen cards shows "a total of $163,745 for
services that the real card holders say they never got or tried to get."

The attached is from the headline story Tuesday 27 December of the
Courier-Mail newspaper (ph: +61 7 2526011, fax: +61 7 2526696) in the state
of Queensland, Australia. I thought it may be of interest to readers of
"Risks" as it covers a number of themes discussed before:

              $25m power bungle - Report slams hi-tech move
                          Exclusive by Ed Southorn

A $25 million project to turn one of the state's power stations into an
automated plant created an unsafe workplace requiring twice the number of
engineers to run, a confidential report reveals.  The new automatic control
systems also caused more than $1.5 million damage to machinery at the
Swanbank station near Ipswich.

...The audit found the Swanbank automatic control system had failed to
protect the plant from damage.  The system had been unable to prevent a
"trip" (temporary shutdown) cutting oil flow to a turbine. This had resulted
in a bent shaft leaving the turbine with reduced generating capacity.
...The automatic alarm system which tells operators how the plant is
functioning was not properly operating almost two years after it was
installed.  ...The report found lack of adequate testing before
commissioning and "waving of proper commissioning and acceptance testing
procedures" and "a single-minded drive to meet target dates."

Police in Israel have started an investigation last week to determine how
the entire population registry of the country has ended up being offered for
sale by a private company, on a CD ROM disk for $1200.

Political parties are entitled to get the voters registry (which includes
people's names, addresses, birth dates and ID number) from the Ministry of
the Interior.  The latest elections in 1992 were the first time this
information was disseminated on a CD ROM and not just printouts; these disks
should have been returned to the Ministry after the elections, and were
coded and numbered, but it's not clear from newspaper reports here how this
coding was done, and how this was supposed to prevent the parties or their
employees from keeping their own copies.

In addition to the registry (which is actually public information, though
not freely available) the government-owned phone company sells a disk
containing all phone books, and the government's companies registry is also
available (I'm not sure if it is sold legally).

All this information enabled a TV reporter to demonstrate getting the list
of all companies privately directed by the minister of Finance (including
the names of all other directors), or the private address and phone number
of the chief of the Mossad and all of his neighbors (which were shown on
screen, though with illegible resolution).

Israel is a small country, but it's only a matter of time and computing
power before this kind of personal information processing is available
everywhere.

Perhaps it didn't happen on Mary Payne's watch; but I do recall there was a
problem with floating point in early VAX-11/780 machines.  Believe it
required a microcode change, and a board swap for machines equipped with a
floating point accelerator.  Then there was the early production G.E. 635
floating point problem which resulted from truncating, rather than rounding,
a 2's complement number, giving a negative bias to the results.  Supposedly
(urban legend alert!) this was recognized as important when a tape calculated
on one of the machines was used to operate a numerically-controlled cutting
torch.  The torch was supposed to cut a circular plate out of a thick piece
of steel.  The actual cut had a jog in it, resembling (coincidentally, I'm
sure) the "Intel Inside" logo.  Then there was the floating point problem
early in the life of the IBM 360 series.  As I recall this was not so much
an error as a surprisingly sudden loss of significance resulting from the
base-16 fractions, such that a shift for exponent alignment shifted four
bits at a time.  And I recall some allegation about an early CDC machine
(1604? 3600?) in which fixed point -1 x -1 = -1.

 &gt; Is this just a ploy to line their pockets from their captive market?

No. Take another look at the figures you quoted. It costs *more* to support
pulse dialing. They can't go 100% touchtone until all their subscribers quit
using old gear. So they have to keep the "pulse counters" around (and
maintained) until then. Therefore, if you want pulse dialing, they are going
to charge you $2 extra each month.

This is the most *sensible* thing I've seen a phone co. do in a long time.
It encourages folks to quit using pulse/rotary phones. And it gives them
hard figures on how many folks still can't use touchtone.

<i>26 Dec 94 22:15:12 EST</i>

In an article by Andrew Lawler in _Science_ magazine (94.11.25; 266:1315)
entitled "Court says no to copying articles," we read of a recent case which
may affect anyone who collects news, newspaper, magazine and journal
articles:

    Thinking of photocopying an article from your favorite journal?
    Think again.  Last month [in October 94] a three-member federal
    appeals court in New York ruled that a Texaco Corp. scientist
    violated copyright laws by making one copy each of eight articles
    in a scientific journal and placing them in his files.  The
    2-1 ruling dramatizes the uncertainty over what constitutes fair
    use of copyrighted material, say lawyers familiar with the case,
    adding that the ruling should prompt companies and universities
    to review their policies toward copying.

According to the author, the suit was launched by the American Geophysical
Union (AGU) and more than 80 other plaintiffs.  They accused Texaco of
"copying and distributing hundreds of scientific articles to hundreds of
researchers" and picked a sample case for the civil suit.

The court ruled that because the scientist in the sample case (David
Chickering, who copied the eight articles from the journal _Catalysis_)
filed the papers away in his library rather than use them immediately, he
was in violation of the fair use laws governing copyrighted materials.

The dissenting judge wrote that because the defendant used the copied
materials for research only, that use fell under existing fair use doctrine.

"Jon Baumgarten of Proskauer. Rpse. Gpetz &amp; Mendelsohn in Washington," one
of the lawyers for the plaintiffs, said that it's not true that "all
educational use is fair use."  He advised academic researchers to "Consult
with your university counsel before making copies."
