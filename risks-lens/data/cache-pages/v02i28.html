<pre>
Dave Parnas in a private note to me has raised a set of concerns involving
the actions and inactions of a particular system.  Those concerns seem very
important to RISKS, and so I quote him here (with his permission).

  "What about the difference between risks of commission and risks of
  omission?  Whenever we speak of a risk it is shorthand for the risk of some
  specific danger.  I consider a risk to be one one of commission if the
  danger is that the system will perform some action from a finite set of
  "bad" things.  A risk is one of omission if the danger is that the system
  does not perform the task that it was built to perform.  I think risks of
  commission are less difficult to deal with than risks of omission for two
  reasons: (1) for risks of commission one can do specific "backward" analysis
  to look for ways that that danger could occur, (2) for risks of commission
  one can include checks and hardware to prevent the danger.  Risks of
  omission are often insurmountable because confidence that they will not
  occur requires a proof of "correctness" or at least a proof of certain
  aspects of correctness.  Do the readers of the forum agree with this
  distinction and evaluation?  Can they site save examples of successful
  software with a severe risk of the omission type?"  [Dave Parnas]

There are several comments that I would like to make, and then I'll turn this
open to the Forum.

The finite set of "bad" things may be incomplete.  An example in the
security community is the multilevel security property — NO FLOW of
information downward to a lower level of security or laterally to another
compartment at the same security level.  This is the property upon which
various security kernels are based.  However, it represents only a portion
of the "bad things" that must be prevented.  Furthermore, proving the NO
FLOW property for a few dozen kernel functions is not enough if the entire
machine language is accessible via assembly language!

Yes, the former may seem easier to deal with — at least superficially.
However, the errors of commission are insidious in that it is very hard to
GUARANTEE their absence.  In many cases the set of properties ("bad things")
is already stated negatively ("X MAY NOT HAPPEN", as in the case of the NO
FLOW property), and applies only abstractly.  Even even if you can
demonstrate that a particular interface (e.g.,a security kernel) satisfies
the desired set of properties (that is, the design satisfies the properties
and the code and hardware together are consistent with the design), the set
of properties may incomplete.  Thus, "correctness" arguments are relevant in
the errors of commission as well — down to and including the hardware.

Dave reminds us of Martin Moore's example of the range safety shuttle
destruct system.

  "Here there are risks of both kinds.  There is a risk that the system may
  destroy a shuttle that performs properly.  There is also a risk that it may
  not destroy a shot that should be destroyed because it is about to crash in
  Miami's heavily populated area.  Martin described how many measures could be
  taken to make the commission risk less likely.  Physical control of data
  paths was one of those measures.  However, it is much harder to see how we
  can make sure that the destruct system will perform.  We would need some
  correctness arguments or extensive testing to have faith that it would
  perform when it should."  [Dave Parnas]

The risks of omission are also insidious in that the model of what must be
done may be incomplete.  While the distinction between errors of commission
and omission is valuable, I suspect that there are essentially equivalent
problems with each, but this is probably of little help in practice.  Both
types of risks must be considered.  Furthermore, in some cases, a given
problem may involve both types of errors.

    order, but I want to get this issue out without further delay.  PGN]

                                           MORE LIKE Mon 14 Mar 7:50AM PST]

Somehow the time-of-date clock on my system got reset to 7 Dec 1984 last
night around 10:40 PM PST, while I was logged in.  I was apparently the only
user on the system at the time, but I was doing nothing unusual.  Could it
have been a dropped bit (despite parity) (I haven't had the patience to do
the calculation of the time difference)? or a time-dependent software
glitch?  At any rate, it is something I had never seen before, and it seems
quite relevant to RISKS.

The side-effects of such a clock burp could be very painful.  (1) A
delete-by-date of older-dated versions of a file results in deletion of the
newest versions actually created.  (2) All of the messages in my mailboxes
were marked as UNSEEN.  In a mailbox with hundreds of messages, that is a
nuisance.  (3) In clock-dependent asynchronous systems, all hell could break
loose.  (Recall the first shuttle launch delay.)  (4) All sorts of other
things might stop working.  (I wonder if anyone ever runs a system in the
virtual past in order to keep the SCRIBE time-bomb from going off, to avoid
paying UNILOGIC for another year!) PGN]

      [I waited to send this issue out until the clock had been corrected,
       in order to minimize further side-effects, notably confusion.]

The following article appeared in the Vancouver Sun (Vancouver,
B.C.), Saturday, March 15th:

            New bills will prove that money can talk

  OTTAWA - It costs six cents to make, wears out in about a year,
  and is an oddball in the U.S., where today it's only worth $1.43.

  Someday it will even be able to talk - in both offical languages.

  It's the new Canadian $2 bill, announced today by the Bank of
  Canada, which has redesigned the deuce - and its $5 pal - for
  introduction later this year.
  ...
  The new bills will also have a feature to assist the
  visually-impaired distinguish denominations.

  Don Bennett, a spokeman for the Bank of Canada, said the new bills
  will have a code printed into them which, when inserted into an
  electronic device, will activate a synthesized "voice" which will
  speak the denomination.

  Bennett said the bank is continuing development work on the
  device, but field tests, which included Vancouver, were recently
  completed.

  Bennett said it will be the end of the decade before the devices
  are in wide-spread use although some may be available by 1987. The
  target cost is below $50.
  ...

My curiousity is how "fool-proof" are these codes (I have not seen
what the codes look like but I suspect something similar to that
imprinted on personal checks) and devices. Does anyone know of
something similar? Will money not only "talk" but "lie" too?

    [I am reminded of the BART and METRO fare cards.  Although the remaining
     fare is encrypted, the magnetic stripe is trivial to copy.  Since the
     encoded signature of the $2 bill will be identical for all $2 bills, in
     principle it should be easy to copy — perhaps onto an OLD $1 that has
     no such markings, although that is not such a great loss.  What about
     higher denominations?  (Holograms embedded in the bill to prevent
     forgeries (as in credit cards) would not help the blind much.)  If you
     were blind, would you have any confidence in a machine that tells you
     that the bill you have just been given by a well-known shyster is a
     perfectly good $1000 bill?  PGN]

The other day, someone finally reached me who had been trying
for several days.  I have a second phone line into my house
that I use only for data — no telephone attached — and it
seems she had gotten that phone number instead of the one I
always use for voice.  Usually I am either using the data line
or the modem is turned off, so she kept getting a busy signal
or no answer.  Once, though, someone — my modem, left on for
once — answered.  It beeped, so she left a message, taking it
for an answering machine.  Took me for the sort who never
returns phone calls.

Peter,

I suggest that if you are as tired of modem stuff as you sound, you
just redirect anybody who wants to talk further to TELECOM@XX.  Lag
time to the various parts of the net is bad enough that you will still
be getting this crud for weeks if you don't put a lid on it.
