Licensing of commercial drones has been limited so far, but it won't be long
before usage starts expanding. In them meantime, CXOs need to assess and
plan for possible legal ramifications.

"Many robots have analog controls on them, which are hard to use and not
very customizable, and you must touch the robot to change anything,"
Moorhead said. "Smartphone control enables control [of robots] away from the
home, and the ability for the manufacturer to more easily provide variables
[to] enhance the experience for the buyer."

The downsides are security issues and the need for the phone. "You don't
want someone hacking in for fun and have your Roomba turn on at 3 am every
morning to wake you up," Moorhead said. "Also, as more vendors move controls
off the robots and onto the smartphone, if you lose it you lost the ability
to control the robot."

  [And if you do not have a smart phone at all, you will not be able to use
  the item.  I have run into this risk in another area.  Despite being a
  loyal 7-11 customer, I can get free Slurpee every so often, because I do
  not have a smart phone.  How companies are cutting off business with this
  forced linkage?]

The Danish municipality of Vesthimmerland in northern Jutland is planning to
introduce autonomous, electric shuttle buses for public transport.

Local politicians hope the initiative will help save both time and money.

"We are a large municipality with long transportation times and our
calculations show that we have 30 to 40 full-time employees who are driving
nonstop," Knud Kristensen, the mayor of Vesthimmerland, told the newspaper
Information.

<a href="http://cphpost.dk/news/driverless-electric-bus-to-be-tested-in-aalborg.html">http://cphpost.dk/news/driverless-electric-bus-to-be-tested-in-aalborg.html</a>

An electric, self-driving shuttle bus is being considered for a public
transport route in the north Jutland city of Aalborg.  If everything goes to
plan in testing, the completely autonomous bus could transport passengers on
a 1.6 km-long route by 2018.

The Arma bus was designed by French company Navya, which introduced the
innovative unmanned vehicle in October 2015.

The FBI is investigating another apparent hack on Democratic Party support
organizations, this time the DCCC (Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee), which is distinct from the DNC (Democratic National Committee)
whose email hack is also under separate investigation.  Once again there is
suspicion that this was a Russian attack.

At the event in Aspen on Saturday afternoon, Mr. Obama's homeland security
adviser Lisa O. Monaco sidestepped specific discussion of the DNC hacking,
but acknowledged that the administration might soon have to consider whether
the United States' electoral system constitutes critical infrastructure,
like the power grid or the cellphone network.

  One of the anonymous sources who spoke to Reuters claims that "the lack of
  full disclosure by the FBI prevented DNC staffers from taking steps that
  could have reduced the number of confidential emails and documents
  stolen."  Last fall, the FBI warned DNC employees to keep an eye out for
  "unusual activity on the group's computer network," without letting on the
  potential seriousness of the hack.  The DNC didn't find any suspicious
  activity, but when staffers asked the FBI for more information about the
  attack on its system, the agency declined.

Trump Shows the Flaws of NSA Surveillance

His call for Russian hackers to break into Hillary Clinton's email validate
the worst suspicions of security-state critics.

Conor Friedersdorf 8:10 AM ET Politics

PHILADELPHIA--On Wednesday, Leon Panetta, the former director of the CIA,
declared on stage at the DNC that the Republican Party's nominee is unfit
for office.  He was responding in part to news that Donald Trump "hoped
Russian intelligence services had successfully hacked Hillary Clinton's
email, and encouraged them to publish whatever they may have stolen,
essentially urging a foreign adversary to conduct cyber-espionage against a
former secretary of state."

For Panetta, that was unforgivable.

"Donald Trump today once again took Russia's side," he said.  "He asked the
Russians to interfere in American politics.  It is inconceivable to me that
any presidential candidate would be that irresponsible.  I say this out of a
firm concern for the future of my children and my grandchildren: Donald
Trump cannot become our commander in chief.  In an unstable world we cannot
afford unstable leadership."

His outrage is understandable—once again, Donald Trump showed that he
lacks the judgment and self-discipline necessary to be a good president of
the United States.

But Panetta is rather late in foreseeing the possibility of such a leader.

A few short years ago, when Edward Snowden revealed the extent of NSA
surveillance on American citizens, corporations, and other institutions, NSA
defenders insisted that the national security establishment can be trusted,
and that civil libertarians were overly paranoid to worry that unprincipled
elites would, sooner or later, exploit the era of mass surveillance to
manipulate the political process.

With the Republican nominee for the presidency openly yearning for a foreign
intelligence agency to hack a political rival, Trevor Timm, one of those
civil libertarians, took the opportunity to issue a reminder: If elected to
the presidency, "Trump would head a vast NSA apparatus he could turn on his
political enemies."  This was, Timm wrote, "always the overarching concern
about NSA: Even IF it's not being abused now, the system would allow future
leaders to wreak havoc."

And the safeguards that NSA defenders always invoke?

"Hopefully if President Trump ever ordered the NSA to hack into the computer
systems of domestic opponents or critics, NSA leaders would refuse," Tim Lee
noted at Vox.  "But the president has the power not only to choose the NSA
director but also to prosecute whistleblowers for leaking classified
information.  So we shouldn't be too confident that internal resistance at
the NSA would stop him."

Jennifer Granick set forth a specific accounting of weaknesses in NSA
oversight.

"The president isn't required to inform Congress or the PCLOB if she changes
Executive Order 12333," she explained.  "She is not required by law to give
Congress notice of or the opportunity to review new Presidential Policy
Directives affecting surveillance.  The FISA Court still has no role in
supervising overseas spying, nor must the president inform Congress when she
initiates new overseas spying programs.  When Office of Legal Counsel
opinions justifying surveillance proposals are written, Congress need not be
told nor given a copy.  If the DOJ changes minimization procedures or FBI
guidelines, it is not required to inform Congress.  Classification continues
to get in the way of oversight.  There is no punishment for people who
violate the law at a president's behest.  And whistleblowers have less, not
more, reason to believe they will be protected and not prosecuted."

I warned, long before the rise of Donald Trump, that Presidents Bush and
Obama were providing all the infrastructure that a tyrant would need to
perpetrate grave abuses of power.  With his rise, I urged elected officials
to tyrant-proof the White House before it's too late.  If the prudence of
doing so wasn't evident before, is it now, with knowledge that Trump soon
won't need the Russians to secure information about the private
communications of every legislator and judge in America, but will presumably
still want to hack into the communications of his rivals?

This danger would be lessened with reforms to the NSA, including a mandate
to purge old data from its vast stores.  At the same time, Trump's outreach
to the Russians underscores the fact that we're now in a reality where any
candidate for president, or the president herself, can seek data from
foreign-intelligence agencies, data that can almost certainly give them
power relative to political adversaries.

One wonders what the British Government Communication Headquarters knows
about Donald Trump.  Might Hillary Clinton ask one day?

So reforming the NSA isn't enough.  The prudent course, for the
U.S. government, is reorienting the agency so that it spends fewer resources
spying on Americans and more on helping to protect the private details of
our lives from actors foreign and domestic.

And there is more to protect beyond our privacy.  Says Jack Goldsmith of
Harvard Law School, "Does the United States government have a well-worked
out plan to ensure that our highly computerized and highly decentralized
system for electing the president is protected from foreign disruption via
cyber-exploitation or cyber-attack?  I have no idea--but I seriously doubt
it."

Better to address these vulnerabilities before they are exploited than to
invite a crisis of democracy even more alarming than a reality-TV star
seeking the presidency.

  Interpol has arrested a top Nigerian email scammer who stole more than
  US$60 million by tricking businesses into handing over funds by posing as
  trusted suppliers.  The 40-year-old Nigerian known as Mike is allegedly
  the leader of a criminal ring that targeted hundreds of victims across the
  world, Interpol said on Monday.  He and at least 40 other individuals
  pulled off their scheme by allegedly pretending to be CEOs or suppliers
  using hacked email accounts of legitimate companies.

  The criminals then sent fake emails, asking the victims to wire funds or
  send payment to bank accounts under the scammers' control.

  The Nigerian at one point conned a victim into paying $15.4 million,
  Interpol said. To hack the email accounts, the scammers targeted small and
  medium businesses in the U.S., India, and Romania, among other countries.

  Amnesty International technologist and researcher Claudio Guarnieri and
  independent security researcher Collin Anderson traced recent Telegram
  account breaches in Iran to the SMS messages Telegram sends to people when
  they activate a new device. The texts contain a verification code that
  Telegram asks people to enter to complete a new device setup.  A hacker
  with access to someone's text messages can obtain these codes and enter
  them to add their own devices to the person's account, thus gaining access
  to their data including chat histories.  The researchers think the Iranian
  hacking group Rocket Kitten is behind the Telegram breaches, based on
  similarities to the infrastructure of past phishing attacks attributed to
  the group. There is widespread speculation that Rocket Kitten has ties to
  the Iranian government.

Yet more examples of SMS text messaging vulnerabilities.

REPORT - NOT FULLY CONFIRMED: If you don't have a cell phone, or some other
means to receive SMS text messages (and have them enabled, and know how to
deal with them), you won't be able to access your Social Security
Administration "My Social Security" account starting next month. There is a
rumor rapidly spreading on the Net, brought to my attention this morning,
claiming that SSA users have been receiving warnings that they MUST receive
an SMS text message with a two-factor authentication code to access their
accounts starting next month.  While I cannot find an official SSA statement
regarding this, there is testimony at the House Oversight Committee from
late May that appears to confirm the essence of this report:

"Additionally, to protect citizens' personally identifiable information
further, we continue to improve authentication for our online services. In
compliance with Executive Order 13681 ("Improving the Security of Consumer
Financial Transactions"), we are changing our current multifactor
authentication process for my Social Security from optional to mandatory for
all users. Upon implementation this summer, all customers must enter a
username, password, and a one-time passcode texted to a registered cell
phone in order to access their my Social Security account. In the future, we
expect to offer additional multi-factor options, pursuant to Federal
guidelines. The National Institute of Standards of Technology is working on
a revised guideline, and we are providing input into that process."

While the "expectation" of other two-factor options in the future is
interesting, the move to block users who do not have cell phones, or text
message capable cell phones, or do not have text messaging enabled, or do
not know how to access and read text messages—IS UNACCEPTABLE, especially
on such short notice.

Two-factor authentication systems are important, but keep in mind that SSA
by definition is dealing mostly with older users who may have only recently
become comfortable with online services at all, and may not make any use of
text messaging. Many do not have cell phones or somebody to receive text
messages for them.

Additionally—and ironically—text messaging is considered to be a
substandard means of receiving two-factor authentications. And—get this
boys and girls—NIST just a few days ago officially declared that text
messaging based two-factor should no longer be used at all—it's simply
not safe and secure.

It appears that SSA has really mucked this one up. This isn't secure
two-factor, it's a three-ring circus. And if deployed as reported, it's
going to leave many SSA users out in the cold.

If you're interested in following more on the controversy regarding the
Social Security Administration requiring that anyone who wants continued
access to their SSA online account *must* be able to receive text messages,
my Friday post on this topic has now attracted almost 30 comments, many from
SSA users who discovered that the requirement is already in place and have
not been able to make it work.

Microsoft is facing two more lawsuits over the company's questionable
Windows 10 upgrade tactics. Both suits are seeking class-action status.

The first suit was filed in U.S. District Court in Florida. It alleges that
Microsoft's Windows 10 upgrade prompts "violated laws governing unsolicited
electronic advertisements," as reported by The Seattle Times. The suit also
says Microsoft's tactics are against the Federal Trade Commission's rules on
deceptive and unfair practices.

The second suit was filed in June in Haifa, Israel alleging that Microsoft
installed Windows 10 on users' computers without consent.  Microsoft already
paid out a $10,000 award in a previous U.S. suit over similar circumstances.

by researchers in 2015 at Black Hat, an annual security and hacking

The flaw wasn't considered a major issue until Windows 8 began allowing

Overnight, the attack got larger in scope, and now it allows an attacker to

pull it out before you set out for a meeting or leave it on (so it looks
like your are at your home or office) and use a "burner"phone that is never
operated near your normal mobile's locations and is discarded after each
meeting.

Ok, I'm going to be judgmental and potentially controversial here, but:

If you rely on a computerised system to feed your dependents and don't
bother to check in on them yourself, in person, or to have a human pet
sitter do so for you - and that _at least_ once a day - frankly, you are a
horrible person and you shouldn't be allowed to have pets in the first
place.

They're real, live creatures. They're not toys. If you can't take
proper, emotionally invested case of them, get an effing Tamagotchi.

Richard, furious and disdainful

2016-07-28 as the 10,001st day of the Web? 1989-03-12 as the start of the
Web? These date seems questionable to me.  According to the History of the
Web at <a href="http://webfoundation.org/about/vision/history-of-the-web/">http://webfoundation.org/about/vision/history-of-the-web/</a>, Sir Tim
Berners-Lee, a software engineer at CERN, came up with the concept of the
Web in March 1990 (a year later than mentioned in this post) and it wasn't
until 1991 that people outside of CERN were invited to join the new Web
community.  So where does the March 1989 date come from?

This NYT article could have been written by Andrew Keen of the breathy "The
Internet Is Not The Answer".  The book cites the death of mighty Kodak as a
tragedy of digitization and nerd billionaires.  Kodak was a creaking
monopoly who's time had come, and so is Gillette.  Gillette just paid a
billion dollar fine for not performing the very same logistic optimisation
Dollar Shave beat them to.  The risk, really, is that Gillette shareholders
might well sack the board for their inertia and short sightedness.

CB&gt; "dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=1M"

CB&gt; Of course you need to replace sda with the actual device name that connects
CB&gt; to the disk you want to clear.

And if you don't you'll zap your home disk. So I would use 'sdz' in such
examples.

A salescritter to convince you that something as simple as a lightbulb needs
to be computerized.

A security geek to think that something may possibly be wrong with that
idea.

A whitehat firm to analyse the attack surface.

Someone to look at the network traffic for disclosures.

Someone to look at the user/management interface.

Someone to look at authentication of commands.

Someone to look at social engineering risks involved in lightbulb jokes.

Someone to note that it is better to light a single candle than to curse the IoT.

Someone else to note that the IoT will soon have many more than a million
points of light.

Someone to pontificate that many IoT devices are not built with security in mind.

Someone else to note that, so far, there are very few actual exploits
available, despite the number of vulnerabilities.

A device systems manager to opine that having a device security manager is not
really necessary.

A device security manager to at least change the passwords that the device
systems manager left on default setting.

A bored teenager to sit and play with the lightbulb for hours trying to
force the "cool light" setting to actually make it turn blue.

An exasperated parent to, very strongly, make the point that a lightbulb
that costs over a hundred dollars every time it burns out is *NOT A TOY*!

Someone to create a Burned Out High Tech Lightbulb account on Twitter.

Someone to propose a "Lightbulb security settings" course to SANS.

Someone at (ISC)^2 to call for CBK entries for a CLBSP (Certified Light Bulb
Security Professional) designation.

Someone to drive a Tesla, on autopilot, through the existing crowd.

Someone to note that a Solo would do far less damage.
