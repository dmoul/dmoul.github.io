A companion piece by Caleb A. Scharf can be found at
<a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/life-unbounded/the-death-of-astronomy/">https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/life-unbounded/the-death-of-astronomy/</a>

Years ago, light pollution from ground sources (sodium or mercury halogen
lamps in street lights) pushed the world's best optical telescope
observatory sites into remote locations.

Astronomers now have to consider erasure of satellite-generated image
streaks from deep-space observations of multi-billion year old galactic
structures. Estimates of 1 in 3 images may require touch-up from LEOS
radiation that enter and leave telescopic field of view.

Constellations of Low Earth Orbit Satellites (LEOS), possibly numbering
~12-15K LEOS, if Amazon.com's 3,000 Kuiper Project constellation flies with
12,000 Starlinks, can reflect sunlight at dawn/dust and microwave radiation
into ground-based telescope observations. The 10.7-12.7 GHz band is
particularly important for radio astronomy, and also for satellite
communications.

"With Starlink, we are expecting at least 100 satellites to be visible at
any one time [at any location on Earth]," says Baskill. "Soon, even those
fortunate to experience a truly dark site will find it filled with a haze of
metal, slowly swarming across the night sky."

Probably low risk: LEO shrouds a NEO (near-Earth orbit) asteroid (NEA,
actually) from detection. Difficult n-body problem to accurately simulate.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-Earth_object">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-Earth_object</a>

This includes credit-card numbers and bank-account information...

EXCERPT:

Quest Diagnostics, one of the biggest blood testing providers in the
country, warned Monday that nearly 12 million of its customers may have had
personal, financial and medical information breached due to an issue with
one of its vendors.

In a filing with securities regulators, Quest said it was notified that
between Aug. 1, 2018, and March 30, 2019, that someone had unauthorized
access to the systems of AMCA, a billing collections vendor.

"(The) information on AMCA's affected system included financial
information (e.g., credit card numbers and bank account information),
medical information and other personal information (e.g., Social Security
Numbers)," Quest said in the filing.

While customers' broad medical information might have been compromised,
Quest said AMCA did not have access to actual lab test results, and so
therefore that data was not impacted...

EXCERPT:

Several million records said to include bank account details, Social
Security digits, wire transactions, and other mortgage paperwork, were
found publicly accessible on the server of a major U.S. financial service
company.

More than 885 million records in total were reportedly exposed, according to
Krebs on Security. The data was taken offline on Friday.  Ben Shoval, a
real-estate developer, reportedly discovered the files online and notified
security reporter Brian Krebs. Krebs said that he contacted the server's
owner, First American Corporation, prior to reporting the incident.

A leading title insurance and settlement services provider, First American
is a large company headquartered in California with more than 18,000
employees. Its total assets in 2017 were reported at over $9.5 billion.

A company spokesperson told Gizmodo it learned about the issue on Friday and
that the unauthorized access was caused by a design defect in one its
production applications. It immediately blocked external access to the
documents, they said, and began evaluating, with the help of an outside
forensics firm, what effect, if any, the exposure had on the security of its
customers' information...

A critical remote command execution (RCE) security flaw impacts over half of
the Internet's email servers, security researchers from Qualys have revealed
today.

The vulnerability affects Exim, a mail transfer agent (MTA), which is
software that runs on email servers to relay emails from senders to
recipients.

NSA whistleblower says "new platforms and algorithms" can have direct
effect on human behavior.

EXCERPTS:

NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden said Thursday that people in systems of
power have exploited the human desire to connect in order to create systems
of mass surveillance.  Snowden appeared at Dalhousie University in Halifax,
Nova Scotia via livestream from Moscow to give a keynote address for the
Canadian university's Open Dialogue Series.  Right now, he said, humanity is
in a sort of "atomic moment" in the field of computer science.  "We're in
the midst of the greatest redistribution of power since the Industrial
Revolution, and this is happening because technology has provided a new
capability," Snowden said.  "It's related to influence that reaches everyone
in every place," he said.  "It has no regard for borders. Its reach is
unlimited, if you will, but its safeguards are not."

Without such defenses, technology is able to affect human behavior.
Institutions can "monitor and record private activities of people on a scale
that's broad enough that we can say it's close to all-powerful," said
Snowden. They do this through "new platforms and algorithms," through which
"they're able to shift our behavior. In some cases they're able to predict
our decisions—and also nudge them—to different outcomes. And they do
this by exploiting the human need for belonging."  "We don't sign up for
this," he added, dismissing the notion that people know exactly what they
are getting into with social media platforms like Facebook.

"How many of you who have a Facebook account actually read the terms of
service?" Snowden asked. "Everything has hundreds and hundreds of pages of
legal jargon that we're not qualified to read and assess --and yet they're
considered to be binding upon us."  "It is through this sort of unholy
connection of technology and sort of an unusual interpretation of contract
law," he continued, "that these institutions have been able to transform
this greatest virtue of humanity—which is this desire to interact and to
connect and to cooperate and to share—to transform all of that into a
weakness."

"And now," he added, "these institutions, which are both commercial and
governmental, have built upon that and... have structuralized that and
entrenched it to where it has become now the most effective means of social
control in the history of our species."  "Maybe you've heard about it,"
Snowden said. "This is mass surveillance."  [...]

Bucking a major trend, company speaks out against the age-old practice.

Microsoft is finally catching on to a maxim that security experts have
almost universally accepted for years: periodic password changes are likely
to do more harm than good.

In a largely overlooked post published late last month, Microsoft said it
was removing periodic password changes from the security baseline settings
it recommends for customers and auditors. After decades of Microsoft
recommending passwords be changed regularly, Microsoft employee Aaron
Margosis said the requirement is an "ancient and obsolete mitigation of very
low value."

The change of heart is largely the result of research that shows passwords
are most prone to cracking when they're easy for end users to remember, such
as when they use a name or phrase from a favorite movie or book. Over the
past decade, hackers have mined real-world password breaches to assemble
dictionaries of millions of words. Combined with super-fast graphics cards,
the hackers can make huge numbers of guesses in off-line attacks, which
occur when they steal the cryptographically scrambled hashes that represent
the plaintext user passwords.

Eyeing Russia, Army fields jam-resistant GPS in Europe
<a href="https://www.c4isrnet.com/show-reporter/c4isrnet-conference/2019/06/06/eyeing-russia-army-fields-jam-resistant-gps-in-europe/">https://www.c4isrnet.com/show-reporter/c4isrnet-conference/2019/06/06/eyeing-russia-army-fields-jam-resistant-gps-in-europe/</a>

WASHINGTON ” With an eye on sophisticated Russian jamming and spoofing
technology, the U.S. Army will field test jam-resistant position, navigation
and timing gear with the 2nd Cavalry Regiment in Germany this September.

The decision comes amid a pattern of Russia jamming or disrupting all sorts
of communications vital to Western forces in recent years, from mobile phone
networks during exercises to electronic warfare against U.S. operations on
the ground in Syria. NATO affirmed that Russia jammed GPS signals during its
Trident Juncture exercise in November in Europe's High North region.

The Army will field a system called Mounted Assured Positioning, Navigation
and Timing, or MAPS, on some of the regiment's vehicles ” news first
reported by Inside the Army. The system uses the Selective Availability
Anti-Spoofing Module for GPS, a chip-scale atomic clock for timing an
anti-jamming antenna to distribute position, navigation and timing
information across a unit's mission equipment.

Russia's electronic warfare capability fueled the fielding to the 2nd
Cavalry Regiment, Army Col. Nicholas Kioutas, the service's project manager
for positioning, navigation and timing, said on the sidelines of the
C4ISRNET Conference held in Arlington, Virginia, June 6.

"Right now what we can learn is how the equipment can hold up, because
unless we're being specifically jammed, we won't be able to tell what
happened," Kioutas said of the upcoming fielding. "We're constantly taking
those systems and stress-testing them and trying to upgrade them, so it's
not like that's the static system and we're done.

The Army is using a flexible acquisitions vehicle called an Other
Transaction Authority with three vendors to develop the second generation of
MAPS. Program office is asking vendors to provide it with their best
technological developments, which is a reflection of the service's less
prescriptive approach to capability development.

"We want industry to show us how to fight a different way," Kioutas said,
adding later, "We said, 'bring us your best capabilities,' we didn't say
what those should be."

The Army plans to experiment with using assured PNT systems as sensors.  One
use would be for a group of linked systems to read the way a jamming signal
strikes them to conclude where the jammer is located. "That'll be an
additional capability down the road that we'll exploit," Kioutas said.

The program office is also developing Dismounted Assured Positioning,
Navigation and Timing, or DAPS, for the Army's version of a smartphone, the
integrated dismounted leader situational awareness system Nett Warrior.

Share of top 1% wealthiest increased to nearly 32% in 2018 from 23% in 1989

EXCERPT:

The rich are getting richer. It is a refrain that has certainly been uttered
before, and likely will again, as Deutsche Bank Securities' chief economist
points out that the gap between the haves and have-nots in the U.S. is,
indeed, widening.

Deutsche Bank's Torsten Sløk says that the distribution of household
wealth in America has become even more disproportionate over the past
decade, with the richest 10% of U.S. households representing 70% of all
U.S. wealth in 2018, compared with 60% in 1989, according to a recent study
by researchers at the Federal Reserve.

The study finds that the share of wealth among the richest 1% increased to
32% from 23% over the same period.

To make a finer point, Fed researchers say the increase in wealth among the
top 10% is largely a result of that cohort obtaining a larger concentration
of assets: “The share of assets held by the top 10% of the wealth
distribution rose from 55% to 64% since 1989, with asset shares increasing
the most for the top 1% of households. These increases were mirrored by
decreases for households in the 50-90th percentiles of the wealth
distribution,'' Fed researchers said.

Sløk said the financial crisis has played a significant part in this
growing gap, which resulted in the Federal Reserve stepping in to stem a
massive ripple of losses through the global financial system as the housing
market imploded.

As a result, the Fed lowered interest rates, which had the knock-on effect
of pushing easy money into the hands of the already-wealthy...

GitHub shocks top developer: Access to 5 years' work inexplicably blocked
Three incidents in the past week illustrate the sometimes unavoidable
risks involved in relying on cloud providers.

Microsoft's code-sharing site GitHub has caused a scare for developer Jason
Rohrer after the company, without explanation or warning, blocked him from
all his code repositories.

The developer yesterday posted a warning on Twitter about the potential risk
to developers of using GitHub “for your life's work'' after he was abruptly
locked out, apparently following a single complaint from another user.

Despite the apology from Friedman and after having received an email from
GitHub support, Rohrer is still in the dark about why his account was
blocked, preventing him from accessing the 5,000 commits and the 23
repositories that he's created over the past five years.

“The biggest problem here was that I wasn't even emailed when my account was
blocked. GitHub emails me notifications all the time. For such an active
account with such a deep history, taking it down in a silent POOF with no
notification? I was greeted with a 404,'' he wrote.

Cloud-hosting outfit DigitalOcean caused an uproar last week after blocking
the account of small AI firm called Raisup. DigitalOcean locked the account
after detecting what it thought was malicious code from Raisup's account.

As Raisup CTO Nicolas Beauvais explained on Twitter, that supposedly
malicious code was a actually a legit Python script it periodically uses to
manage its databases.

“We lost everything, our servers, and more importantly one year of database
backups. We now have to explain to our clients, Fortune 500 companies why we
can't restore their account,'' said Beauvais.

Finally, Google this week had some explaining to do regarding Sunday's
extensive four-hour outage, which impacted Google services as well as firms
that rely on Google Cloud.

A configuration change destined for a small group of servers in one region
was wrongly applied by a machine or human to a larger number of servers
across several neighboring regions. It resulted in regions having less than
half their network capacity.

EXCERPT:

The former leader of the U.S. government's top-secret UFO program has
stories to tell, and he is sharing some of them for the first time in a new
documentary.

Intelligence officer Luis Elizondo served as the former director of the
Pentagon's Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), an
initiative launched in 2007 to study reports of UFO encounters. Elizondo
departed the agency in 2011; in 2017, he spoke with reporters at The New
York Times, confirming the existence of the shadowy agency and describing
its mission.

Now, Elizondo is pulling back the curtain on his tenure with the AATIP,
which he left because of a lackluster official response to the agency's
findings, and their unwillingness to address potential risks from UFOs,
according to the new show *Unidentified: Inside America's UFO
Investigation*, premiering May 31 on the History Channel at 10 p.m ET/9
p.m. CT. [UFO Watch: 8 Times the Government Looked for Flying Saucers]

No, there isn't a big reveal that UFOs were alien spacecraft all along. But
delving into long-hidden accounts of UFO investigations will hopefully
encourage people—and authorities—to overcome long-standing stigmas and
talk more openly about these mysterious aircraft, some of which may pose a
bigger threat than we realize, Elizondo told Live Science...

The Trump administration will implement a new policy Friday asking most
applicants for U.S. visas to provide information on their use of social
media, a U.S. Department of State official tells Hill.TV

Most visa applicants, including temporary visitors, will be required to
list their social media identifiers in a drop down menu along with other
personal information.

Applicants will have the option to say that they do not use social media if
that is the case. The official noted that if a visa applicant lies about
social media use that they could face “serious immigration consequences''
as a result.

For now, the drop down menu only includes major social media websites, but
the official said applicants soon will be able to list all sites that they
use.

“This is a critical step forward in establishing enhanced vetting of
foreign nationals seeking entry into the United States.  As we've seen
around the world in recent years, social media can be a major forum for

For Immediate Release

FCC AFFIRMS ROBOCALL BLOCKING BY DEFAULT TO HELP PROTECT CONSUMERS

Commission Also Seeks Comment on Requiring Caller ID Authentication
Implementation and Use of Authentication Standards for Blocking

WASHINGTON, June 6, 2019”The Federal Communications Commission today
voted to make clear that voice service providers may aggressively block
unwanted robocalls before they reach consumers.

Specifically, the Commission approved a Declaratory Ruling to affirm
that voice service providers may, as the default, block unwanted calls
based on reasonable call analytics, as long as their customers are
informed and have the opportunity to opt out of the blocking.  This
action empowers providers to protect their customers from unwanted
robocalls before those calls even reach the customers' phones.  While
many phone companies now offer their customers call blocking tools on an
opt-in basis, the Declaratory Ruling clarifies that they can provide
them as the default, thus allowing them to protect more consumers from
unwanted robocalls and making it more cost-effective to implement call
blocking programs.

The ruling also clarifies that providers may offer their customers the
choice to opt-in to tools that block calls from any number that does not
appear on a customer's contact list or other "white lists."  This option
would allow consumers to decide directly whose calls they are willing to
receive.  Consumer white lists could be based on the customer's own
contact list, updated automatically as consumers add and remove contacts
from their smartphones.

The Commission also adopted a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that
proposes requiring voice service providers to implement the SHAKEN/STIR
caller ID authentication framework, if major voice service providers
fail to do so by the end of this year.  It also seeks comment on whether
the Commission should create a safe harbor for providers that block
calls that are maliciously spoofed so that caller ID cannot be
authenticated and that block calls that are "unsigned."

With adoption of this item, the Commission continues its multi-pronged
strategy to combat unwanted and illegal robocalls.  The Declaratory
Ruling will go into effect upon release of the item on FCC.gov.  The
deadline for submitting comments in response to the Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking will be established upon publication in the Federal Register.

Action by the Commission June 6, 2019 by Declaratory Ruling and Third
Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (FCC 19-51).  Chairman Pai,
Commissioners Carr and Starks approving.  Commissioners O'Rielly and
Rosenworcel approving in part and dissenting in part.  Chairman Pai,

Smart home devices such as Amazon's Echo and virtual assistants such as
Alexa or Apple's Siri can provide a lot of information about a person --
when they're at home, what they're interested in and potentially even what
they're saying. So it's no surprise that criminal investigators are
interested in their potential.

In Germany, the issue is setting up a clash between the interior ministry --
the country's equivalent to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security—and
the justice ministry, which keeps an eye on the constitutionality of what
other departments are up to.

The federal interior ministry is preparing to back a proposal from the state
of Schleswig-Holstein to make evidence from smart devices and virtual
assistants admissible in court, the RND news organization reported
Wednesday. The idea is to make the information available to investigators of
serious crimes and terrorist threats.

"Our view is that digital traces have become increasingly important. We are
talking about traces that come from connected devices such as smart fridges
but also voice-controlled devices such as smart speakers," a spokesman for
the interior ministry told the Financial Times.

Unconstitutional?

However, the justice ministry does not appear to be on board. Gerd Billen,
the ministry's state secretary, said "law enforcement must be up-to-date,
but there are limits set by the protection of the most personal spaces, and
the freedom of accused people not to incriminate themselves. These limits
must not be circumvented by any technology."

When Apple executive Craig Federighi described a new location-tracking
feature for Apple devices at the company's Worldwide Developer Conference
keynote on Monday, it sounded—to the sufficiently paranoid, at least”like
-- both a physical security innovation and a potential privacy disaster. But
while security experts immediately wondered whether Find My would also offer
a new opportunity to track unwitting users, Apple says it built the feature
on a unique encryption system carefully designed to prevent exactly that
sort of tracking—even by Apple itself.

In upcoming versions of iOS and macOS, the new Find My feature will
broadcast Bluetooth signals from Apple devices even when they're offline,
allowing nearby Apple devices to relay their location to the cloud. That
should help you locate your stolen laptop even when it's sleeping in a
thief's bag. And it turns out that Apple's elaborate encryption scheme is
also designed not only to prevent interlopers from identifying or tracking
an iDevice from its Bluetooth signal, but also to keep Apple itself from
learning device locations, even as it allows you to pinpoint yours.

At Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday, the company debuted a
slew of products and services, including a new Mac Pro that's part raw
computing power, part cheese grater. But one new feature, mentioned in
passing, could have an outsized impact on user security and privacy for
years to come. Apple now has its own single-sign-on scheme—and it's a
major reimagining of how such a mechanism can work.

You've seen single-sign-on before, even if you don't use it. It's the
technology that lets you use your Google or Facebook login to access other
third-party services, instead of needing to set a unique username and
password for each one. They centralize a group of accounts around a more
secure login that you're more likely to actively monitor and maintain,
rather than a one-off account that you set with a weak password, save a
credit card into, and then never think about again.

Sign In with Apple looks similar enough to those alternatives at a glance,
giving the option to use your Apple ID as a unified login wherever
developers integrate it. But as part of its broader, years-long privacy
push, Apple has added some extra protections that distinguish its version.

Well, I don't think it's any secret that I am of the opinion that social
media isn't exactly important.
<a href="https://community.isc2.org/t5/Welcome/The-quot-Community-quot/m-p/10594">https://community.isc2.org/t5/Welcome/The-quot-Community-quot/m-p/10594</a>

Which makes the US decision to require "five years" of social media account
information when applying for a visa all the more bizarre.
<a href="https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2019/06/04/us-visa-applicants-required-to-hand-over-social-media-info/">https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2019/06/04/us-visa-applicants-required-to-hand-over-social-media-info/</a>

First: sorry, "five years"?  What five years?  Five years of postings?
(Given it's an online form, that's unlikely.)  Accounts I've started in the
past five years?  (Does that mean my Twitter account is exempt because it's
older than that?)  Accounts I've used in the past five years?  (Does that
mean that my Facebook account, which I haven't posted to in the past five
years, is exempt?)  Or do you want the Facebook account because I've had to
use it occasionally because people who posted what they thought was a public
message couldn't figure out Facebook's byzantine aggregation of rights and
permissions?

What's considered social media?  The Facebook I don't use?  The Twitter I
do?  The extra Twitter account that I only use for posting notices for our
local chapter?  The extra, extra Twitter account that I use (professionally)
for noting and researching spam, malware, and other unsavoury Twitter
accounts?  The Whatsapp account that I created in order to test Whatsapp,
and now use, infrequently, to send update notices to Gloria because that
phone account has limited text messages?

Should I include the Instagram that's in my name, but which Gloria uses
because she likes to keep up with the kids, but she didn't want to create
her own account, and I only look at when she tells me about something
worthwhile?

How about the Flickr account which I created more than five years ago, and
last posted anything on more than five years ago, but which I send
publishers to when they demand a photo to put next to something they are
going to publish?

Or should I create a number of new, sanitized social media accounts for
applying for visas when I go the the States?  (Don't tell me that all kinds
of people aren't going to be doing this ...)  OK, so far they aren't
demanding passwords, so it's only public postings that they can look at,
but, after all, this is supposed to be "social" media ...

Do I get to tell whoever is processing my visa application that anything
referring to "Friday" is not to be taken seriously?  (Come to think of it,
that wouldn't do any good anyway, since anyone in a civil service job is
bound to have had their sense of humour surgically removed, and wouldn't get
any of the infosec jokes anyway ...)

Is the ISC2 "community" a social media site?

Are the Amish forbidden from applying for visas?

Is this the thin edge of the wedge for "Total Information Awareness" again?

Do you really think terrorists are going to post their plans on the same
social media accounts that they are going to give the government?  (Yeah,
yeah, but the really dumb ones can be caught in other ways, like adding a
question to the form that says, "Are you planning on carrying out any
terrorist attacks while in the United States?")  Do you think that DHS has
people or AI skilled enough to identify fake accounts given on the forms and
use forensic linguistics to link those to actual accounts really used by the
applicant?  (Honestly?  You think that's likely?)

Oh, and everything I've said here is private, right?

Trump urges customers to drop AT&amp;T to punish CNN over its coverage of him

The president has been vocal in his opposition to a AT&amp;T-Time Warner merger,
which critics contend is motivated by his ire toward CNN.

Limbic capitalism, a neologism, "refers to a technologically advanced but
socially regressive business system in which global industries, often with
the help of complicit governments and criminal organizations, encourage
excessive consumption and addiction. They do so by targeting the limbic
system, the part of the brain responsible for feeling and for quick
reaction, as distinct from dispassionate thinking."

Limbic capitalism monetizes and exploits the brain's reservoir of dopamine
to build dependence. Mobile apps prey upon unsuspecting or vulnerable
populations by over-stimulating dopamine dependency.

I wonder if governments will eventually begin to rank and regulate mobile
apps dopamine delivery on minute-by-minute basis, or per app event, and use
this information to build another MSA? A mobile app "rationing" system (or
tax) might materialize to forcibly curtail dopamine addiction.

A cold-turkey solution might be most effective to cut addition. With
antitrust drums beating louder in Congress, the call to regulate screen time
might be on the horizon.

One year out from the 2020 elections, presidential candidates face legal
roadblocks to acquiring the tools and assistance necessary to defend against
the cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns that plagued the 2016
presidential campaign.

Federal laws prohibit corporations from offering free or discounted
cybersecurity services to federal candidates. The same law also blocks
political parties from offering candidates cybersecurity assistance because
it is considered an "in-kind donation."

The issue took on added urgency this week after lawyers for the Federal
Election Commission advised the commission to block a request by a Silicon
Valley company, Area 1 Security, which sought to provide services to 2020
presidential candidates at a discount. The commission is expected to decide
on Area 1's request at a public meeting on Thursday.

Cybersecurity and election experts say time is running out for campaigns to
develop tough protections.

I was awakened by a phone call this morning.  Obviously recorded, probably
computer generated.

Telling me that there were spurious charges on my Visa card.

Right off there were indications that this was a fraud.  First off, it
didn't identify the issuing bank, and identified the card by saying the
number started with 45.  (*All* Visa cards start with 45 ...)  Also, while
the message was recorded or generated, there was no change in tone when the
message got to identifying the charges.  Recorded calls using something out
of a database usually have a slight change in tone at that point.  (I
figured it was a bit of a gamble telling me that I had a charge from Amazon
for $300 and one from Google Play for $1,000, since I might deal with those
entities, but I suppose the risk is small.)

I was supposed to stay on the line for a security agent, but I didn't feel
like playing games with them.  I assume someone would have been trying to
get info that they could then use to actually perpetrate a fraud on my card.

A bit later I went to the bank.  They obviously knew about the calls and the
 script.  (And confirmed that there were no charges or flags on our card.)

Chuck Karish opines in <a href="https://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/31/27">RISKS-31.27</a> that Boeing's statement, that
angle-of-attack (AoA) indicator and the "AOA Disagree" alert are not
necessary for the safe operation of the Boeing 737 MAX, "misrepresents the
situation". Karish opines "the AOA Disagree alert is a vital indication to
the pilots that MCAS is malfunctioning and that corrective action is
needed."

One can ask the operators themselves, the pilots. When the Boeing statement
was released, I asked some senior pilots for major airlines, with whom I
have been corresponding for some decades, what they thought. There are two
components to the Boeing statement, which it is useful to separate:

1). AoA indication is not necessary for the safe operation of the Boeing 737
MAX.

2). The "AOA Disagree" alert on the Primary Flight Display (PFD) is not
necessary for the safe operation of the Boeing 737 MAX.

Concerning 1), the pilots who responded generally agree that AoA indication
is not necessary, and does not help much if at all, when flying commercial
transport aircraft.

JT 610 and ET-302 are not the first accidents concerning which the question
of AoA indication in commercial transports has arisen. In their final report
on the 2009 accident to AF 447, an Air France A330 lost over the South
Atlantic during a flight from Brazil to France, the BEA recommended "that
EASA and the FAA evaluate the relevance of requiring the presence of an
angle of attack indicator directly accessible to pilots on board aeroplanes".
(See Section 4.2.2 of the Final Report at
<a href="https://www.bea.aero/docspa/2009/f-cp090601.en/pdf/f-cp090601.en.pdf">https://www.bea.aero/docspa/2009/f-cp090601.en/pdf/f-cp090601.en.pdf</a>)

AoA indication on commercial transports has been debated for far longer than
this.  For example, there was an article about it nearly twenty years ago in
Boeing Aero magazine #12, March 2000:
<a href="http://www.boeing.com/commercial/aeromagazine/aero_12/attack.html">http://www.boeing.com/commercial/aeromagazine/aero_12/attack.html</a>

Given the decades of such engineering and operational debate about it
amongst all stakeholders, it would have surprised me had Boeing said
something misleading about 1).

Concerning 2), a senior pilot, qualified on the Boeing 737 (all varieties)
and undergoing the required recurrent training, pointed out that having an
"AoA disagree" indication does not change flight crew response to the
aerodynamic situation at all. The Boeing 737 MAX checklist for an "AoA
disagree" indication warns that AS and altitude information might disagree
or be unreliable. That's it (I am told). That information is already present
on the PFDs, in rather more prominent form than the "AoA disagree"
alert. And the stick shaker might also activate, as it did during the
accidents to JT-610 and ET-302. The stick shaker is a very tactile warning
of being in an approach-to-stall regime and that crew should pay immediate
attention to AS. He concluded that an "AoA disagree" alert indeed counts as
supplementary information, and not as necessary information. That directly
contradicts Karish's opinion that it is "vital".

Boeing's statement seems completely consistent with their, and other
experts', long-standing engineering and operational judgment about AoA
indications and alerting on commercial transport aircraft. One may disagree
with those engineering and operational judgments. But the trope of
"regulatory capture", suggested by Karish, doesn't enter into it at all.

In his response to my post in RISKS.31-27, Prof. Ladkin does not address the
clause that gives that post its meaning: "Once the MCAS takes control of the
airplane away from the pilots". Boeing built the MCAS because they
anticipated that pilots would not be able to safely operate the 737 MAX
airplane manually in certain flight conditions. While an experienced pilot
might not need a working AOA indicator to fly the airplane, the MCAS does
need it. Installation of the MCAS made the AOA indicators safety critical.

That assertion is incorrect. Both crews were theoretically able to control
their aircraft until comparatively late in the development of each
upset. Indeed, this is illustrated by the flight of PK-LQP immediately
preceding JT 610, where the selfsame phenomenon manifested and the crew
completed the flight safely.

I add the caveat "until comparatively late" because there is some question
whether, during the development of the upset situation in both flights, the
aircraft entered a regime in which they could not be manually retrimmed
because of aerodynamic forces inhibiting pilot movement of the trim
wheel. That is not a fault in itself - such regimes are "a fact of
[aerodynamic] life", according to a distinguished aerodynamicist
colleague. However, there is continued discussion as to how and why the
crews could have got into that regime, if indeed they did.

These accidents were not deterministic. It is not as if, when MCAS cut in
because of the sensor malfunction, the crew became powerless and the flights
were doomed. There has been extensive discussion in pilot forums as to what
went on, why it went on, and how and why the respective crews might have
reacted differently. And presumably there is considerable discussion of this
matter within the accident investigations themselves.

&gt; Boeing built the MCAS because they anticipated that pilots would not be
&gt; able to safely operate the 737 MAX airplane manually in certain flight
&gt; conditions.

That is not so. See
<a href="https://abnormaldistribution.org/index.php/2019/04/30/ieee-spectrum-on-possible-software-involvement-in-two-recent-airliner-crashes/">https://abnormaldistribution.org/index.php/2019/04/30/ieee-spectrum-on-possible-software-involvement-in-two-recent-airliner-crashes/</a>
for the reason I was given as to why the MCAS function was added to the STS.

&gt; While an experienced pilot might not need a working AOA indicator to fly
&gt; the airplane, the MCAS does need it.

The MCAS function needs a working AoA sensor.

&gt; Installation of the MCAS made the AOA
&gt; indicators safety critical.

No, not cockpit indications such as AoA display or "AOA Disagree" alert.

The correct operation of the AoA sensor itself is "safety-critical" in
informal terms. Formally, the AoA sensor is, on the Boeing 737 MAX, a
non-redundant causal component of a subsystem with a malfunction severity of
"hazardous". (Whether the classification as "hazardous" was/is appropriate
is another question arising from the accidents.)

In my submission to <a href="https://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/31/27">RISKS-31.27</a> I was a bit too critical of Boeing's May 5
press release. The MCAS doesn't depend on the "angle of attack indicator"
for safety, it depends directly on the angle of attack sensor. In the
context of the then-current uproar the press release was misdirection
rather than mischaracterization.

Are over-the-air (OTA) updates new functionality? Link to Consumer's Reports
article from April 2018 is
<a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/automotive-technology/automakers-embrace-over-the-air-updates-can-we-trust-digital-car-repair/">https://www.consumerreports.org/automotive-technology/automakers-embrace-over-the-air-updates-can-we-trust-digital-car-repair/</a>
with a brief mention of security. Link to GM Canada, at least a year old, is
<a href="https://www.onstar.com/ca/en/software_terms/">https://www.onstar.com/ca/en/software_terms/</a> is informative.

One question reading the T&amp;C is whether the vehicle pulls the updates or the
more risky push from a central server. Doesn't negate the risk of buggy new
software (as compared to buggy old software) nor the annoyance of unwanted
features updates.
