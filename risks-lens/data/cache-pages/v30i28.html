  The campaign of French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron says it has
  been the target of a "massive hacking attack" after a trove of documents
  was released online. The campaign said that genuine files were mixed up
  with fake ones in order to confuse people. It said that it was clear the
  hackers wanted to undermine Mr Macron ahead of Sunday's second round
  vote. The centrist will face off against far-right candidate Marine Le
  Pen.

We have already seen plenty of vulnerabilities in Fingerprint systems -
notably including a dummy finger made from a photograph taken at a press
conference...

Don't forget that changing your password is a lot easier than changing your
fingerprint ;-)

Here is another one.  It seems that it is possible to create "a synthetic or
real partial fingerprint that serendipitously matches one or more of the
stored templates for a significant number of users."

MasterPrint: Exploring the Vulnerability of Partial Fingerprint-based
Authentication Systems

Abstract: This paper investigates the security of partial fingerprint-based
authentication systems, especially when multiple fingerprints of a user are
enrolled. A number of consumer electronic devices, such as smartphones, are
beginning to incorporate fingerprint sensors for user authentication. The
sensors embedded in these devices are generally small and the resulting
images are, therefore, limited in size. To compensate for the limited size,
these devices often acquire multiple partial impressions of a single finger
during enrollment to ensure that at least one of them will successfully
match with the image obtained from the user during authentication. Further,
in some cases, the user is allowed to enroll multiple fingers, and the
impressions pertaining to multiple partial fingers are associated with the
same identity (i.e., one user). A user is said to be successfully
authenticated if the partial fingerprint obtained during authentication
matches any one of the stored templates. This paper investigates the
possibility of generating a MasterPrint, a synthetic or real partial
fingerprint that serendipitously matches one or more of the stored templates
for a significant number of users. Our preliminary results on an optical
fingerprint dataset and a capacitive fingerprint dataset indicate that it is
indeed possible to locate or generate partial fingerprints that can be used
to impersonate a large number of users. In this regard, we expose a
potential vulnerability of partial fingerprint-based authentication systems,
especially when multiple impressions are enrolled per finger.

  [Also noted by Gabe Goldberg:

    Three Indian-American researchers have shown that the fingerprint-based
    security systems used in smartphones and other gadgets are way more
    vulnerable to hacking than we imagined.
  But: The researchers have not conducted any testing with real phones, and
  security experts have pointed out that the match rate would be much lower
  in real-life conditions, and the actual risk "difficult to quantify".

  Master fingerprints can unlock almost any phone, bypassing fingerprint
  security in seconds

  Hmm. Slightly incoherent popularization, distortion, exaggeration.

  Sixty Egyptian members of parliament recently approved a draft law on "the
  regulations of using and exploiting social media networks." If adopted by
  the parliament, the law would require social media users in Egypt to
  register with a government authority in order to use social media websites
  including Facebook and Twitter. The law would establish a department
  tasked with granting citizens permission to use social media.  Within six
  months of the law's adoption, users would have to register on the
  department's website with their real names and state ID numbers to be able
  to use social media networks.  Failure to do so could bring punishment of
  up to six months in jail and a fine. The six-article draft law, which was
  circulated by local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines
  social media as "any application that works via the Internet and is used
  to communicate with others via voice, video messages and text."

  China's State Council Information Office released updated regulations on 2
  May that will restrict individuals from writing and reading news stories
  from individual blogs and social media, including Sina Weibo and
  WeChat. Under the news rules, users will be required to obtain a permit
  before writing or distributing news on social media.  The updated version
  of the "Provisions for the Administration of Internet News Information
  Service" will take effect on June 1, 2017.  Along with restrictions on
  news reporting, the rules will also require individuals to submit real
  identity information when subscribing to a news information service.

Dave Parnas noted to me that the title of this item was wrong and quite
misleading.  The man in question was not fined for finding a flaw.  He was
fined for using a legally restricted title.  No objections were voiced to
his doing the calculations, but in his letters he repeatedly claimed to be
an Engineer and the fine was explicitly about that.

This has been misleadingly reported in other media.  Misleading information
of course creeps into RISKS, and I appreciate Dave helping me to correct the
record.  Elsewhere it was even sillier.  Dave heard a CBC program that said
that the man was fined for using mathematics.

Dave believes that, ideally, nobody should call one's self a Software
Engineer unless they have a license that confirms their qualifications and
the area of practice for which they are qualified.  For example, someone who
is qualified to work as an electrical engineer is not necessarily qualified
to design a road or to write software.  He stresses the *ideally* because
the licensing systems that he knows do not use the proper standards for
Software Engineering.

Many U.S. states and Canadian provinces treat the title similarly to the way
that they treat MD, Lawyer, and Architect—requiring some sort of license.
Dave is a Licensed Engineer (P.Eng) in Ontario.  He is licensed because he
had an accredited Engineering degree and then passed two written exams by
the local authorities.  His license does not state his area of practice, but
it obliges him not to practice in areas outside his area of competence.

Laws and regulations may vary from one jurisdiction to another.
Consequently, a person qualified to work in Ontario or Sweden would not
automatically be qualified to work in Oregon.  Dave believes that someone
who wants to work as an Engineer in Oregon should present his or her
professional records to the Oregon authorities, and apply for a license.

Important to note that this example is from 2010, and there was never any
confirmation that it had an impact.  Bruce Schneier discussed it briefly on
his blog and included links to three Swedish newspaper articles that claim
the attack failed.
(<a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2010/10/pen-and-paper_s.html">https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2010/10/pen-and-paper_s.html</a>)

Not disputing that it's a potential threat; just for the record it appears
to have been unsuccessful.

The more interesting (related) case was the District of Columbia experiment
(which was before the software was used in a real election - and as a
result, the software was NOT used in a real election).  In that case, a
command injection (not SQL injection) was the key to manipulating the
election.  The flaw was discovered by Alex Halderman and his team of grad
students at Univ of Michigan.

Someone wrote to me and suggested that while a 100% self-driving vehicle
would be very hard to make, 80% or 90% would be doable.  But that would be
incredibly dangerous.  If my car is driving 90% of the time, I'm not likely
to be paying attention on the rare occasions that it needs my help.  I'll be
taking a nap or, as in the Tesla crash where the driver was watching a movie
as his car drove into the side of a semi-trailer.

This is already a problem on airplanes with automated systems that do almost
all of the work, so the crew can get bored and distracted. This was arguably
the cause of the Air France crash off Brazil, where what should have been a
minor problem, a bad reading due to ice on a sensor, turned into a disaster
because the pilot didn't recognize what it was.

So let's say we back down to 50%, say the car can drive itself on the
freeway but not on surface streets.  The car's coming to the exit, it sounds
the chime a few times to tell the driver to take over.  But the driver has
fallen asleep.  The car sounds the chimes louder, driver doesn't wake up.
Now what?  Will we have to build a parking lot at every exit?

&gt;I think a more reasonable hack would be to put up lots of false stop signs
&gt;or stop lights.  An always red stoplight would be (1) inexpensive and (2)
&gt;tie up traffic.

I'm not sure how this is a risk of technology unless the technologies are
metal bending and light bulbs.  Fake stop signs and traffic lights would
confuse human drivers at least as much as they'd confuse robots.

The fact that we don't see fakes even after a century of stop signs and
traffic lights (invented in 1915 and 1914 respectively) suggests that fakes
are not a significant risk.

&gt; The risk? Not answering the question the article poses: So why is the
&gt; federal agency responsible for our road safety looking to introduce a
&gt; totally avoidable roadblock to automotive innovation by mandating a severely
&gt; flawed technological standard for vehicle communications?

And why is the article pointing out that "the problem with only some cars
supporting DSRC is that Cadillacs will be able to avoid other Cadillacs with
DSRC but not non-Cadillacs without it", and then it advocates "let the
manufacturers compete to find out which technology is best"—which will
actively encourage cars not to communicate with each other!

This is reminiscent of the mobile phone situation, where any European phone
would work in any European country because of a mandated standard, while an
American phone might not even work in the next city down the road!

The other problem I can see with the article is that it seems to advocate
the 5G solution which I guess relies on a central switching centre. In other
words, if I'm in the boondocks without a tower in range, I won't be able to
communicate with the car next to me five feet away!

Predicting Supreme Court decisions has always been pretty easy, even before
computers.  For example, Ulmer's 1963 article "Quantitative Analysis of
Judicial Processes" demonstrated a success rate of 95% based on just 4
factors in search and seizure cases.  Yet this is only a year after Weiner's
1962 article "Decision Prediction by Computers: Nonsense Cubed and Worse".

With the extreme polarization of the Supreme Court nominating process,
Supreme predictions are likely to get even easier, since "mistakes" such as
Earl Warren and William Brennan won't likely be repeated.

Due to the high stakes involved, one might want to start scanning future
Supreme Court nominees for embedded control "chips". :-)

&gt; What that means for film archivists with perhaps tens of thousands of LTO
&gt; tapes on hand is that every few years they must invest millions of dollars
&gt; in the latest format of tapes and drives and then migrate all the data on
&gt; their older tapes—or risk losing access to the information altogether.

It most certainly does *not* mean that. It might mean that film archivists
must retain hardware capable of reading the obsolescent tapes.

As it happened, about 10-12 years ago the British government of the
day was proceeding with plans for ID cards and a national identity
database; not sure how far it got, but I remember thinking at the
time how many instances like those above would come to light, and
if the database could ever have been 'clean' enough to be
worthwhile.   (UK equivalent to SSN is National Insurance
number.   At the telecomms company where I worked, this was once
used as an employee reference until the data protection authority
pointed out the security risk, so a specially-created different
number was used instead.)

A 'one truth' database probably looks like a wonderful idea in a discussion
paper or when presented at a conference, but I suspect that personal
identity is a more nebulous concept in real life.
