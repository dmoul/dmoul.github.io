<a name="subj1.1" href="#subj1.1" id="subj1.1"><i class="flash fas fa-bolt"></i></a> WELCOME TO RISKS@SRI-CSL</h3>
<address>Peter G. Neumann &lt;Neumann@SRI-CSLA.ARPA&gt;</address>
<p>
This is the first issue of a new on-line forum.  Its intent is to address
issues involving risks to the public in the use of computers.  As such, it
is necessarily concerned with whether/how critical requirements for human
safety, reliability, fault tolerance, security, privacy, integrity, and
guaranteed service (among others) can be met (in some cases all at the same
time), and how the attempted fulfillment or ignorance of those requirements
may imply risks to the public.  We will presumably explore both deficiencies
in existing systems and techniques for developing better computer systems —
as well as the implications of using computer systems in highly critical
environments.
</p>
<h4>Introductory Comments</h4>
<p>
This forum is inspired by the letter from Adele Goldberg, President of the
Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), in the Communications of the ACM,
February 1985 (pp. 131-133).  In that message (part of which is reproduced
below), Adele outlined the ACM's intensified concern with our increasingly
critical dependence on the use of computers, a concern which culminated in
the ACM's support for a Forum on Risks to the Public in Computer Systems
(RPCS), to be developed by the ACM Committee on Computers and Public Policy
(of which I am currently the Chairman).  My involvement in this BBOARD
activity is thus motivated by my ACM roles, but also by strong feelings that
this topic is one of the most important confronting us.  In keeping with ACM
policy, and with due respect to the use of the ARPANET, we hope to attain a
representative balance among differing viewpoints, although this clearly
cannot be achieved locally within each instance of the forum.
</p>
<p>
For discussions on requirements, design, and evaluation techniques for
critical systems — namely, how to do it right in the first place so that a
system can satisfy its requirements and can continue to maintain its desired
abilities through ongoing maintenance and evolution, you will find a little
solace in the literature on computer science, computer systems, and software
engineering.  There is even some modest encouragement from the formal
verification community — which readers of the ACM SIGSOFT Software
Engineering Notes will find in the forthcoming August 1985 special issue on
the verification workshop VERkshop III.  However, it is not encouraging to
find many developers of critical software ignoring what is known about how
to do it better.  In this RISKS forum, we hope that we will be able to
confront some of those problems, and specifically those where risks to the
public are present.
</p>
<p>
You should also be aware (if you are not already) of several related on-line
services:  HUMAN-NETS@RUTGERS for a variety of issues pertaining to people
(but originally oriented to the establishment of WorldNet), SOFT-ENG@MIT-XX
for software engineering, and perhaps SECURITY@RUTGERS for security — it is
still young and rather narrow (car-theft prevention is big at the moment,
with a few messages on passwords and forged mail headers).  (You can get
more inforation from SRI-NIC.ARPA:&lt;NETINFO&gt;INTEREST-GROUPS.TXT.)  I look at
these regularly, so some cross-fertilization and overlap may be expected.
However, the perspective of RISKS seems sufficiently unique to justify the
existence of still another interest group!
</p>
<h4>RISKS Forum Procedures</h4>
<p>
I hope all this introductory detail does not deter you, but it seems to be
worthwhile to set things up cleanly from the beginning.  To submit items for
distribution, send mail to RISKS@SRI-CSL.ARPA.  For all other messages
(e.g., list additions or deletions, or administrative complaints), send to
RISKS-Request@SRI-CSL.ARPA.
</p>
<p>
Submissions should relate directly to risks to the public involving computer
systems, be reasonably coherent, and have a brief explicit descriptive
subject line.  Flames, ad hominem attacks, overtly political statements, and
other inappropriate material will be rejected.  Carefulness, reasonably
clear writing, and technical accuracy will be greatly appreciated.  Much
unnecessary flailing can be avoided with just a little forethought.
</p>
<p>
Contributions will generally be collected and distributed in digest form
rather than singly, as often as appropriate.  Subject lines may be edited in
order to group messages with similar content.  Long messages may have
portions of lesser interest deleted (and so marked), and/or may be split
across several issues.
</p>
<p>
Initially we will provide distributions to individuals, but as soon as there
are more than a few individuals at any given host, we will expect the
establishment of a file &lt;BBOARD&gt;RISKS.TXT or equivalent on that host — with
local option whether or not to forward individual copies.  Back issues may
be FTPed from SRI-CSL.ARPA:$lt;RISKS$gt;RISKS-“vol”.“no”, where “vol” and “no” are
volume and number — i.e., <a href="/Risks/1/01">RISKS-1.1</a> for this issue.  But please try to rely
on local repositories rather than swamping the gateways, nets, and SRI-CSL.

<a name="subj2.1" href="#subj2.1" id="subj2.1"><i class="flash fas fa-bolt"></i></a> ACM Council Resolution of 8 October 1984</h3>
<address>Peter G. Neumann &lt;Neumann@SRI-CSLA.ARPA&gt;</address>
<p>
Following are excerpts from ACM President Adele Goldberg's letter in the
Communications of the ACM, February 1985 (pp. 131-133).
</p>
<p>
  On this day [8 October 1984], the ACM Council passed an important
  resolution.  It begins:
</p>
<p>
    Contrary to the myth that computer systems are infallible, in fact
    computer systems can and do fail.  Consequently, the reliability of
    computer-based systems cannot be taken for granted.  This reality
    applies to all computer-based systems, but it is especially critical
    for systems whose failure would result in extreme risk to the public.
    Increasingly, human lives depend upon the reliable operation of 
    systems such as air traffic and high-speed ground transportation 
    control systems, military weapons delivery and defense systems, and
    health care delivery and diagnostic systems.
</p>
<p>
  The second part of the resolution includes a list of technical questions
  that should be answered about each computer system.  This part states that:
</p>
<p>
    While it is not possible to eliminate computer-based systems failure
    entirely, we believe that it is possible to reduce risks to the public
    to reasonable levels.  To do so, system developers must better
    recognize and address the issues of reliability.  The public has the
    right to require that systems are installed only after proper steps
    have been taken to assure reasonable levels of reliability.
</p>
<p>
    The issues and questions concerning reliability that must be addressed
    include:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
    What risks and questions concerning reliability are involved when
       the computer system fails?
</li>
<li>
    What is the reasonable and practical level of reliability to
       require of the system, and does the system meet this level?
</li>
<li>
    What techniques were used to estimate and verify the level of
       reliability?
</li>
<li>
    4. Were the estimators and verifiers independent of each other
       and of those with vested interests in the system?
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Adele's letter goes on to motivate the ACM's authorization of a forum on
risks to the public in the use of computer systems, of which this is an
on-line manifestation.  As you can see, I believe that the charter must be
broader than just reliability, including as appropriate other critical
requirements such as fault tolerance, security, privacy, integrity,
guaranteed service, human safety, and even world survival (in sort of
increasing order of globality).  There is also an important but probably
sharply delimited role for design verification (such as has been carried out
in the multilevel-security community in demonstrating that formal
specifications are consistent with formal requirements) and even code
verification (proving consistency of code and specifications), although
formal verification technologies seem not suited to mammoth systems but only
to selected critical components — assuming that those components can be
isolated (which is the operative assumption in the case of security kernels
and trusted computing bases).  For example, see the VERkshop III proceedings
noted above.  PGN

<a name="subj3.1" href="#subj3.1" id="subj3.1"><i class="flash fas fa-bolt"></i></a> AN AGENDA FOR THE FUTURE</h3>
<address>Peter G. Neumann &lt;Neumann@SRI-CSLA.ARPA&gt;</address>
<p>
One of the activities of the ACM Committee on Computers and Public Policy
will be the review of a problem list presented by Dan McCracken and his
committee in the September 1974 issue of the Communications of the ACM, and
an update of it in the light of dramatic changes in the use of computers
since then.  Three items from that problem list are particularly relevant to
our RISK forum.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Computers and money</li>
   <li>Computers and privacy</li>
   <li>Computers and elections</li>
</ul>
<p>
Indeed, in the latest issue of the ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes
(July 1985), I reported on a variety of recent money problems, security
problems, and a whole string of potential election-fraud problems — in the
last case suggesting opportunities for Trojan Horses and local fraud.  On
the third subject, there was an article by David Burnham (NY Times) in
newspapers of 29 July 1985 (NY Times, SF Chron, etc.), on vulnerabilities in
various computerized voting systems.  About 60% of the votes are counted by
computer programs, with over a third of those votes being counted by one
program (or variants?) written by Computer Election Systems of Berkeley CA.
Burnham writes, “The allegations that vote tallies calculated with [that
program] may have been secretly altered have raised concern among election
officials and computer experts… In Indiana and West Virginia, the company
has been accused of helping to rig elections.”  This topic is just warming
up.
</p>
<p>
Items that also give us opportunities for discussions on risks to the
public include these:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Computers and defense</li>
   <li>Computers and human safety</li>
   <li>Computer-user consumer protection</li>
   <li>Computers and health</li>
   <li>Informal and formal models of critical properties
     (e.g., not just of security or reliability, not 
      so high-level as Asimov's 3 Laws of Robotics)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Several items on computers and defense are included below.  There are also
some comments on software that is safe for humans.
</p>
<p>
I would think that some sort of Ralph-Nader-like consumer protection
organization might be appropriate for computing.  We have already had two
very serious automobile recalls due to program bugs — the El Dorado brake
computer and the Mark VII computerized air suspension, and at least two
heart pacemaker problems (one which resulted in a death), as noted in the
disaster list below — to go along with this summer's watermelon recall
(pesticides) and Austrian wine recalls (with the antifreeze-component
diethylene glycol being used as a sweetener).

<a name="subj4.1" href="#subj4.1" id="subj4.1"><i class="flash fas fa-bolt"></i></a> COMPUTER-RELATED INCIDENTS ILLUSTRATING RISKS TO THE PUBLIC</h3>
<address>Peter G. Neumann &lt;Neumann@SRI-CSLA.ARPA&gt;</address>
<p>
Readers of the ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes have been alerted in
many past issues to numerous disasters and computer curiosities implying
potential or actual risks to the public.  A summary of events is catalogued
below, and updates earlier versions that I circulated in a few selected
BBOARDS.  Further details can be found in the references cited.  Awareness
of these cases is vital to those involved the design, implementation, and
operation of computer systems in critical environments, but is of course
not sufficient to prevent new disasters from occurring.  Significantly
better systems, and more aware operation and use, are also required.

       SOME COMPUTER-RELATED DISASTERS AND OTHER EGREGIOUS HORRORS
              Compiled by Peter G. Neumann (21 July 1985)

The following list is drawn largely from back issues of ACM SIGSOFT Software
Engineering Notes [SEN], references to which are cited as (SEN vol no), where 
vol 10 = 1985.  Some incidents are well documented, others need further study.

<a name="subj6.1" href="#subj6.1" id="subj6.1"><i class="flash fas fa-bolt"></i></a> STRATEGIC DEFENSE INITIATIVE (SDI)</h3>
<p>
The Strategic Defense Initiative (popularly known as Star Wars) is
considering the feasibility of developing what is probably the most complex
and most critical system ever contemplated.  It is highly appropriate to
consider the computer system aspects of that effort here.  Some of the
potential controversy is illustrated by the recent statements of David
Parnas, who presents a strongly skeptical view.  (See below.)  I hope that
we will be able to have a constructive dialogue here among representatives
of the different viewpoints, and firmly believe that it is vital to the
survival of our world that the computer-technical issues be thoroughly
discussed.  As in many other cases (e.g., space technology) there are many
potential research advances that can spin off approaches to other problems.
As indicated by my disaster list above, the problems of developing software
for critical environments are very pervasive — and not just limited to
strategic defense.  But what we learn in discussing the feasibility of the
strategic defense initiative could have great impact on the uses that
computers find in other critical environments.  In general, we may find that
the risks are far too high in many of the critical computing environments on
which we depend.  We may also be led to techniques for developing better
systems that can adequately satisfy all of their critical requirements —
and continue to do so.  But perhaps most important of all is the increased
awareness that can come from intelligent discussion.  Thus, an open forum on
this subject is very important.  PGN

SCIENTIST QUITS ANTIMISSILE PANEL, SAYING TASK IS IMPOSSIBLE
</p>
<p>
By Charles Mohr
special to the New York Times
</p>
<p>
Washington, July 11 - A computer scientist has resigned from an advisory panel
on antimissile defense, asserting that it will never be possible to program a
vast complex of battle management computers reliably or to assume they will
work when confronted with a salvo of nuclear missiles.
</p>
<p>
  The scientist, David L. Parnas, a professor at the University of Victoria
in Victoria, British Columbia, who is consultant to the Office of Naval
Research in Washington, was one of nine scientists asked by the Strategic
Defense Initiative Office to serve at $1,000 a day on the “panel on computing
in support of battle management”.
</p>
<p>
  Professor Parnas, an American citizen with secret military clearances, said
in a letter of resignation and 17 accompanying memorandums that it would never
be possible to test realistically the large array of computers that would link
and control a system of sensors, antimissile weapons, guidance and aiming
devices, and battle management stations.
</p>
<p>
  Nor, he protested, would it be possible to follow orthodox computer
program-writing practices in which errors and “bugs” are detected and
eliminated in prolonged everyday use. …
</p>
<p>
  “I believe,” Professor Parnas said, “that it is our duty, as scientists and
engineers, to reply that we have no technological magic that will accomplish
that.  The President and the public should know that.”  …
</p>
<p>
  In his memorandums, the professor put forth detailed explanations of his
doubts.  He argued that large-scale programs like that envisioned for the
program only became reliable through modifications based on realistic use.
</p>
<p>
  He dismissed as unrealistic the idea that program-writing computers,
artificial intelligence or mathematical simulation could solve the problem.
</p>
<p>
  Some other scientists have recently expressed public doubts that large-scale
programs free of fatal flaws can be written.  Herbert Lin, a research fellow
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said this month that the basic
lesson was that “no program works right the first time.”
</p>
<p>
  Professor Parnas wrote that he was sure other experts would disagree with
him.  But he said many regard the program as a “pot of gold” for research
funds or an interesting challenge.
</p>
<aside>
[The above article is not altogether accurate, but gives a flavor of the
Parnas position.  The arguments for and against feasibility of success need
detailed and patient discussion, and thus I do not try to expand upon either
pro or con here at this time.  However, it is hoped that a serious
discussion can unfold on this subject.  (SOFT-ENG@MIT-XX vol 1 no 29
provides some further material on-line.)  See the following message as well.

<p>
                               Abstract
</p>
  A battle management system for comprehensive ballistic missile defense
  must perform with near perfection and extraordinary reliability.  It
  will be complex to an unprecedented degree, untestable in a realistic
  environment, and provide minimal time for human intervention.  The
  feasibility of designing and developing such a system (requiring upwards
  of ten million lines of code) is examined in light of the scale of the
  project, the difficulty of testing the system in order to remove errors,
  the management effort required, and the interaction of hardware and
  software difficulties.  The conclusion is that software considerations
  alone would make the feasibility of a “fully reliable” comprehensive
  defense against ballistic missiles questionable.

<a name="subj8.1" href="#subj8.1" id="subj8.1"><i class="flash fas fa-bolt"></i></a> Minireview of Freeman Dyson's Weapons and Hope</h3>
<address>Peter Denning &lt;pjd@RIACS.ARPA&gt;</address>
<div class="date">Tuesday 30 Jul 85 17:17:56 pdt</div>
<p>
I've just finished reading WEAPONS AND HOPE, by Freeman Dyson, published
recently.  It is a remarkable book analyzing the tools, people, and concepts
used for national defense.  The goal is to set forth an agenda for
discussing the nuclear weapons problem.  The most extraordinary aspect of
the book is that Dyson fairly and accurately represents the many points of
view with sympathy and empathy for each.  He thus transmits the impression
that it is possible for everyone to enter into and participate intelligently
in this important debate, and he tells us what the fundamental questions we
must address are.  This book significantly altered the way in which I
personally look at the problem.  I recommend that everyone read it and that
we all use it as a point of departure for our own discussions.
</p>
<p>
Although Dyson leaves no doubt on his personal views, he presents his very
careful arguments and lays out all the reasoning and assumptions where they
can be scrutinized by others.  With respect to the SDI, Dyson argues
(convincingly, I might add) that the greatest risk comes from the
interaction of the SDI system with the existing policies of the US and
Soviet Union — it may well destabilize that interaction.  His argument is
based on policy considerations and is largely insensitive to the question
whether an SDI system could meet its technical goals.  For other reasons he
analyzes at length, he considers the idea of a space defense system to be a
technical folly.
</p>
<p>
Most of the arguments I've seen computer scientists make in criticism of the
"star wars" system are technically correct and support the technical-folly
view but may miss the point at a policy level.  (I am thinking of arguments
like
</p>
<p>
  "Computer scientists ought to oppose this because technically it
  cannot meet its goals at reasonable cost.")  
</p>
<p>
The point is that to the extent that policy planners perceive the technical
arguments as being largely inessential at the policy level, they will not
take seriously arguments labelled
</p>
<p>
  "You must take this argument seriously because it is made by computer
   scientists."  
</p>
<p>
Politicians often argue that is their job to evaluate the spectrum of
options, make the moral judgments, and puts risks in their proper place —
technologists ought to assess the risks, but when it comes to judging
whether those risks are acceptable (a moral or ethical judgment),
technologists have no more expertise than, say, politicians.  So in a
certain important sense, computer scientists have little special expertise
to bring to the debate.  For this reason, I think ACM has taken the right
approach by giving members <span class="aside">[and nonmembers! &lt;PGN&gt;]</span> a forum in which to
discuss these matters as individual human beings but without obligating ACM
to take official positions that are easily dismissed by policy planners as
outside ACM's official expertise.

survivability of our existing communications and rapidly broadened into a
consideration of the computer systems as well.  I cite several examples in

<p>
An important area of concern to the RISKS forum is what is often called
Software Safety, or more properly the necessity for software that is safe
for humans.  (“Software Safety” could easily be misconstrued to imply making
the software safe FROM humans, an ability that is called “integrity” in the
security community.)  Nancy Leveson has been doing some excellent work on
that subject, and I hope she will be a contributor to RISKS.  There are also
short letters in the ACM Forum from Peter Fenwick (<cite>CACM December 1984</cite>) and
David Nelson (<cite>CACM March 1985</cite>) on this topic, although they touch only the
tip of the iceberg.  I would expect human safety to be a vital topic for
this RISKS forum, and hope that we can also help to stimulate research on

<blockquote>
  23-25 October 1985, Rome, Italy (organized by Sipe Optimation and T&amp;TSUD,
  sponsored by Banca Nazionale del Lavoro).  Italian and English.  Organizers
  Roberto Liscia (Sipe Optimation, Roma, via Silvio d'Amico 40, ITALIA, phone
  039-6-5476), Eugenio Corti (T&amp;TSUD, 80127 Napoli, via Tasso 428, ITALIA),
  Peter G. Neumann (SRI International, Menlo Park CA 94025).  Speakers include
  Neumann, Bill Riddle, Severo Ornstein (CPSR), Alan Borning (U. Washington),
  Andres Zellweger (FAA), Sandro Bologna (ENEA), Eric Guldentops (SWIFT).  The
  program addresses a broad range of topics (including technical, management,
  social, and economic issues) on the use of computer systems in critical
  environments, where the computer systems must be (e.g.) very reliable,
  fault-tolerant, highly available, secure, and safe for humans.  This 
  symposium represents an effort to provide a unified basis for the 
  development of critical systems.  Software engineering and the role of
  the man-machine interface are addressed in detail.  There will also be
  case studies of air-traffic control systems, defense systems, funds 
  transfer, and nuclear power.  Contact Roberto Liscia (or Mrs. De Vito) at
