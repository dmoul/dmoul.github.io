ACM TechNews, Wednesday, August 21, 2019

A study by researchers at New York University found that at least 16 million
Americans in eight states will vote on completely paperless machines in the
2020 U.S. elections, despite a strong consensus among cyberosecurity and
national security experts that paper ballots and vote audits are necessary
to ensure election security. While the states in question are not
historically battleground states, some are likely to be more closely
contested than usual. Said U.S. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, "Congress needs
to set mandatory federal election security standards that outlaw paperless
voting machines and guarantee every American the right to vote with a
hand-marked paper ballot." Wyden cited experts as requiring hand-marked
paper ballots and post-election audits to defend against hacking. "Vendors
should recognize that fact or get out of the way."

A French security researcher has found a critical vulnerability in the
blockchain-based voting system Russian officials plan to use next month for
the 2019 Moscow City Duma election.

Pierrick Gaudry, an academic at Lorraine University and a researcher for
INRIA, the French research institute for digital sciences, found that he
could compute the voting system's private keys based on its public
keys. This private keys are used together with the public keys to encrypt
user votes cast in the election.

MOSCOW BLOCKCHAIN VOTING SYSTEM ENCRYPTION BROKEN IN 20 MINUTES

Gaudry blamed the issue on Russian officials using a variant of the ElGamal
encryption scheme that used encryption key sizes that were too small to be
secure. This meant that modern computers could break the encryption scheme
within minutes.

"It can be broken in about 20 minutes using a standard personal computer,
and using only free software that is publicly available," Gaudry said in a
report published earlier this month.

"Once these [private keys] are known, any encrypted data can be decrypted as
quickly as they are created," he added.

Laura Hautala, CNet 15 Aug 2019) via ACM TechNews, 23 Aug 2019

U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg has ordered Georgia not to use its
paperless voting machines, election management software, or servers for the
2020 election, requiring the state to implement a new voting system in time
for the presidential primaries. Georgia is currently acquiring new
electronic voting machines and vote-counting software. The court order will
prevent the state from relying on its paperless voting machines and election
management software if the replacement infrastructure is not ready in time;
should this happen, Georgia may have to fall back on paper ballots. Attorney
David Cross said the order “is a big win for all Georgia voters and those
working across the country to secure elections and protect the right to
vote.''

Patrick Byrne says that he helped the "Deep State" investigations.

He also says that the FBI ordered him to pursue a relationship with Russian
(spy? agent? dupe?) Maria Butina.

Oh.  And he also wanted to change Overstock from a "cheap furniture" company
to a "blockchain" company.  So caveat emptor ...

"The Federal Emergency Management Agency has wasted more than $3 billion and
misused thousands of its employees by responding to hundreds of undersized
floods, storms and other events that states could have handled on their own,
an investigation by E&amp;E News shows."

As noted in <a href="http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/31/36#subj12">http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/31/36#subj12</a>, nations and
localities are struggling to plan prioritized disaster response
allocation. FEMA-level response dilution, partially driven by climate
change, threatens US resilience—a portentous sign of bad risk mitigation
planning at a strategic level.

Maintainers of the RubyGems package repository have yanked 18 malicious
versions of 11 Ruby libraries that contained a backdoor mechanism and were
caught inserting code that launched hidden cryptocurrency mining operations
inside other people's Ruby projects.

The individual behind this scheme was active for more than a month, and
their actions were not detected.

Things changed when the hacker managed to gain access to the RubyGems
account of one of the rest-client developers, which he used to push four
malicious versions of rest-client on RubyGems.

Valve gets heavily criticized for mishandling a crucial bug report.
<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/researcher-publishes-second-steam-zero-day-after-getting-banned-on-valves-bug-bounty-program/">https://www.zdnet.com/article/researcher-publishes-second-steam-zero-day-after-getting-banned-on-valves-bug-bounty-program/</a>

Valve has responded to the publication of this second Steam zero-day.  Due
to the length of the response, we chose to cover it as a separate
article. Original story below.

A Russian security researcher has published details about a zero-day in the
Steam gaming client. This is the second Steam zero-day the researcher has
made public in the past two weeks.

However, while the security researcher reported the first one to Valve and
tried to have it fixed before public disclosure, he said he couldn't do the
same with the second because the company banned him from submitting further
bug reports via its public bug bounty program on the HackerOne platform.

At the public library in Wilmer, Tex., books were checked out not with the
beeps of bar code readers but with the scratches of pen on notebook paper.
Out on the street, police officers were literally writing tickets—by
hand. When the entire computer network that keeps the small town's
bureaucracy afloat was recently hacked, Wilmer was thrown into the digital
Dark Ages.

This has been the summer of crippling ransomware attacks. Wilmer—a town
of almost 5,000 people just south of Dallas—is one of 22 cities across
Texas that are simultaneously being held hostage for millions of dollars
&lt;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/20/us/texas-ransomware.html?module=inline">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/20/us/texas-ransomware.html?module=inline</a>&gt;
after a sophisticated hacker, perhaps a group of them, infiltrated their
computer systems and encrypted their data. The attack instigated a statewide
disaster-style response that includes the National Guard and a widening
F.B.I. inquiry.

More than 40 municipalities have been the victims of cyberattacks this year,
from major cities such as Baltimore, Albany and Laredo, Tex., to smaller
towns including Lake City, Fla. Lake City is one of the few cities to have
paid a ransom demand—about $460,000 in Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency --
because it thought reconstructing its systems would be even more costly.
(<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/07/us/florida-ransom-hack.html?module=inline">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/07/us/florida-ransom-hack.html?module=inline</a>)

In most ransomware cases, the identities and whereabouts of culprits are
cloaked by clever digital diversions. Intelligence officials, using data
collected by the National Security Agency and others in an effort to
identify the sources of the hacking, say many have come from Eastern Europe,
Iran and, in some cases, the United States. The majority have targeted
small-town America, figuring that sleepy, cash-strapped local governments
*are the least likely to have updated their cyberdefenses or backed up their
data*...

Gloria asked me to have a look at an email message "from" our bank.

Other than addressing her as an "esteemed" customer, it looked pretty good.
No problems with spelling or grammar.  A security warning at the bottom.
The head office address for the bank.

When I looked at the headers, there were only a few, very small, indications
of possible problems.  It was sent from a domain that was not owned by the
bank, but a lot of companies are outsourcing a lot of IT functions, so that
wasn't exactly definitive.  It had a couple of headers indicative of spam
filtering.

About the only thing that solidly demonstrated a problem was the
verification link in the body of the message, but that a) won't be visible
to most, and b) isn't a really strong indication unless you really know how
to read URLs.

(Now if banks start outsourcing account verification ...)

Apple warns its credit card doesn't like leather or denim or other cards.

  [Just in case there is someone on the planet who does not know how special

Yes, Apple went and published care instructions for its new credit card.

I used to think that the $999 XDR monitor stand was the most Apple thing
Apple ever made. But then the company came out with a credit card that
needed its own care instructions.

Yes, care instructions. For a credit card.

Apple goes into great detail on how to keep your flashy laser-etched
titanium Apple Card looking its finest. Store it in "a wallet, pocket, or
bag made of soft materials," don't store it with another credit card because
it might become scratched, and give it the occasional clean with a "soft,
slightly damp, lint-free microfiber cloth."

White titanium card is afraid of most things people use to carry ID and
coinage, like wallets and pockets.

Oh dear, that card appears to be on a hard surface.

Apple has detailed a number of things that its newly launched titanium
credit card should be kept away from.

A support note from Cupertino, spotted by AppleInsider, says the card should
be kept away from leather and denim to avoid discoloration, and also away
from hard surfaces, to avoid scratching its white finish.

Users are warned not to use household cleaners on the card, nor compressed
air and aerosols, nor any solvents, or ammonia, or anything abrasive to
clean it.

Buddhism with a robotic priest it believes will change the face of the
religion—despite critics comparing the android to "Frankenstein's

The android Kannon, based on the Buddhist deity of mercy, preaches sermons
at Kodaiji temple in Kyoto, and its human colleagues predict that with
artificial intelligence it could one day acquire unlimited wisdom.  "This
robot will never die, it will just keep updating itself and evolving,"
priest Tensho Goto told AFP.  "That's the beauty of a robot. It can store
knowledge forever and limitlessly.  "With AI we hope it will grow in wisdom

&gt; Facial recognition software mistook 1 in 5 California lawmakers for

A better headline and subhead for the original story might be:

  Software Set At 80% Confidence Level Works Correctly 80% Of The Time;
  Software Used With Default Values Rather Than Recommended Values Doesn't
  Work Well

Amazon does seem disingenuous with its claim that the software should be
used at the 99% confidence level when matching faces, while shipping with
the default set to 80%.  As we've seen here, many users who should know
better never change from default settings.

Note that the 80% default value didn't appear in the linked story, but in
another on the same topic that I had read earlier:

I did not see what types of charging stations were involved.

The flip side is that reversing flow and drawing power from e-vehicles has
been proposed has been proposed as a way to smooth out demand spikes and to
store surplus wind and solar power when they are parked plugged in.

I have to speculate that this risk involves Level 3 or higher stations.

With the demise of the last gas station in downtown Vancouver BC, and the
proliferation of "free" (TANSTAAFL) or pay to use fast charging stations at
parking lots and underground garages this might be a risk, but not likely
for 110 or 220 volt charging stations. I did not bother to install a level 2
charger for our plug in hybrid because it charges from the carport plug in
5.5 hours with about the same draw as a major kitchen appliance.

Other protection in the electric distribution system could put them offline
before a large section goes down. Canadian wiring specs require the top and
bottom sockets of kitchen counter outlets, and adjacent outlets, to be on
separate circuits. You need at least 4 circuits to wire a kitchen according
to code if you have 2 or more kitchen outlets.

Don't Grid Controllers in the UK have TVs in the control rooms to monitor
Football (Soccer in Canadian &amp; USA English) games because so many fans tend
to plug in electric kettles during long pauses and ad breaks? Pumped Hydro
Electric Storage generators in Wales and elsewhere can be spun up to meet
those demand surges when the operators see a break coming. We don't need
electric cars to experience this type of power demand surge.

In Canada the equivalent is the Hockey Game Flush, as thousands of fans
flush toilets, creating a risk of municipal water lines collapsing or having
infiltration due to sharp drops in water pressure. System ops watch the
game, ready to start turbo boost pumps during breaks and stop them at the
end of the break.

Rushing into print or digital publication of new startling results from
recently deployed or newly developed instruments is a known risk in Climate
Research.

Someone rushed into print with an "Oceans are Cooling" paper, based on
comparing early Argo Buoy data with older XBT data. With the wisdom of
hindsight the Argo data had a Cold bias and the XBT data had a Warm
bias. Longer term study revealed the bias in both instruments.

<a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/OceanCooling">https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/OceanCooling</a>

Instrument Bias also came up when Anthony Watt enlisted an army of fans to
create a list of "poorly sited" weather stations which they felt gave a warm
bias to the NOAA conclusion of a warming trend in the Continental USA. NOAA
repeated the analysis, excluding those stations, and got a slightly stronger
warming trend. Be careful what you ask for.
