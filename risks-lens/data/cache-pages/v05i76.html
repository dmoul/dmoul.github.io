In <a href="/Risks/5/75">RISKS 5.75</a> Wm Brown III makes some interesting observations about the
reliability differences between microprocessors and relay logic (prompted by a
discussion about using microprocessors to control railroad switching). What I
would like to discuss here is how systems react when a portion of the system
*does* fail. Since I am involved in the design of microprocessor-based
real-time control systems, this area is of great interest to me.

In my opinion designers should always consider the worst situation that can
result from the failure of a component. Part of this should include determining
what events might be missed or ignored if a particular component fails. The
system's reaction to the component failure must take these events into account.
For example, a microprocessor might be used in a robot arm to monitor an
electric eye that detects when something is in the path of the arm. If the
microprocessor fails the system's reaction must include whatever it would do if
the electric eye beam had been broken, for there is no way for the system to
determine the state of the beam (and it must assume worse case). Note that all
of this does little good if the system does not detect that the microprocessor
failed (and detecting the failure may be a bigger problem than reacting to it).

Computer control has the potential to allow greater flexibility than previous
technologies. This flexibility brings with it new risks (which have been
discussed many times in RISKS). It is essential that such systems be designed
so that their reaction to failures will be predictable and safe.
                                                                     Don

Professor Ed McCluskey at Stanford has shown that the MTBF of computer
systems does depend on usage/load.  This isn't surprising for software, but
I remember seeing something (in an abstract) about how load affects hardware
failures as well.  It was surprising enough to remember, but not interesting
enough for me to investigate further.

In <a href="/Risks/5/75">Risks 5.75</a>, George Bray writes with respect to the Therac accident:

   &gt;On the other hand, I believe that the bug was due to an unforeseen
   &gt;interaction that would be very hard to eliminate.  These kinds of bugs
   &gt;probably exist in much of the software in thw [sic] world.

If a reasonable person would agree that bugs exist in much of the present
software, then it seems that it is also reasonable that features be built into
the system to protect against such bugs.  Non-computerized versions of such
machines usually contain interlocks to prevent such catastrophic behavior.
These same interlocks can be built into the software (or into the hardware) to
protect against software errors.  If it is standard practice to include such
features by hardware engineers, should it not be standard practice for software
engineers?  Shouldn't somebody have thought to include "reasonableness" checks
in the AECL software?  I have heard aeronautical engineers speak of a "safety
envelope" and seen them include design features to detect when the safety
envelope is violated and to recover from such events.  It is often possible to
determine the "safety envelope" of software behavior and include checks when it
is being violated.  Of course, checking routines can also have bugs in them,
but they are often much simpler than the original software and provide an
independent check that reduces the risk, probably significantly.

Do we teach programmers to expect software errors and to build the software
to detect and handle erroneous or unsafe states resulting from software bugs?  
If manufacturers of hardware devices can be sued for not taking reasonable care 
by including safety features in their devices, couldn't manufacturers of 
software be similarly liable for not doing the same?

[By the way, for those interested, I have heard that AECL has settled out of
court with the families of the victims.  There is still one suit outstanding in
which the hospital where two people were killed is suing for their money back.
They do not believe that the problems have truly been fixed and do not want to
use the machine anymore.  One might note that AECL claimed the problem was
fixed before a third person was killed a year ago in Yakima].

In <a href="/Risks/5/71">Risks 5.71</a> Eugene Miya suggests 

&lt; If we are ever going to progress out of the software muck, we are going 
&lt; to have to come up with mechanisms to replace all of our anecdotal
&lt; information with better information.

I agree.  One part of the 'software muck' is illicit code, e.g., Trojan
horses, viruses, etc.  It is EXTREMELY difficult to obtain any examples of
illicit code, as any organization which has been bitten by one of these
bugs does not want to be responsible for exacerbating the situation by
letting the illicit code out to possibly infect another system.

The software security community needs to study the diseases which we are
trying to defend against, as potential defenses created in a vacuum of
information will only work in a vacuum.  A clearinghouse, repository,
library, or whatever name one wants to give to such a function should be
set up so that those of us who are trying to build defenses can have
subjects to study.  

There are, however, a number of sticky issues revolving about setting up
such a clearinghouse.  

    1) How do you trust the repository?  How does one know that
information given to the repository will not be abused, nor will it be used
against the giver? 

    2) How does the clearinghouse know who to disseminate which
information to in order not to violate issue number 1?  How does one decide
on who has a legitimate need to see 'dangerous' information, e.g., details
on viruses, trap doors, etc.

    3) The clearinghouse must not be an information sink, sucking up
information from anyone willing to donate their examples but never giving
any information out.  It must be clear that the purpose of the
clearinghouse is to facilitate the sharing of information in a non-
threatening way.

    4) The clearinghouse must not be an organization that people are
inherently scared of, "If I tell them what happened, what are they going to
do to me?"

    5) There must be some mechanism to validate the information coming to
the clearinghouse to insure that it is correct.  We do not want a
repository of misleading, invalid data.

    6) Who's going to pay for this service?

There are organizations which collect information about computer crime. 
One which immediately comes to mind is SRI.  Maybe this or some other
organization could be a starting point?

One issue which will certainly come up in trying to collect, organize, and
disseminate this information will be classification.  Is the data
unclassified, classified (C,S,TS,...), sensitive, proprietary, ...?  I
believe that if issue number one, trust in the clearinghouse, is solved,
the issue of putting information in its proper category is administratively
solvable.  

I could see great value in collecting examples of illicit code (and, of
course, corresponding risks).  What have people really done?  How can we
learn from the examples?  What generic technical defenses can be developed
which specific companies/organizations can then apply to their systems?

Anyone interested in discussing these issues in a workshop setting, either
classified or unclassified, commercial or government - please contact me.

Maybe we can come up with a workable mechanism to not only replace all of
our anecdotal information, but to persuade some of the hidden information
to come out of the woodwork.

  GAMBLER WHO WIRED HIMSELF TO COMPUTER FACES TRIAL

  Carson City [AP] — The [Nevada] state Supreme Court upheld a ruling against 
  a man who wired his athletic supporter to a hidden microcomputer to improve 
  his odds of winning at blackjack.  The ruling Thursday revived a charge of
  possessing a cheating device that had been filed against Philip Preston
  Anderson in Las Vegas.

  According to the court, Anderson strapped a microcomputer to his calf.  Wires
  ran to switches in his shoes that he could tap with his toes to keep track of
  the cards that had been played.  The computer calculated Anderson's advantage
  or disadvantage with the house and sent "vibratory signals to a special
  receiver located inside an athletic supporter," the Supreme Court said.

[The gentleman must be very well endowed.  Otherwise the state Supreme Court
would have declined to hear the case, on the ancient legal principle, "de
minimis non curat lex." — ARA]

It seems the main problem is blindly relying on expert systems, because of lack
of time and expertise. A well designed expert system should therefore give not
only the answers, but also the decision path by which it got at them. A country
doctor may not have all the knowledge that a hospital system provides, but may
well be qualified to judge whether a decision like 'the patient has blue eyes
therefore it's pneumonia' is valid in a particular case.

  From: Alan Wexelblat &lt;wex%SW.MCC.COM@MCC.COM&gt;
&gt; They helpfully informed me that they had no way of retreiving my card,
&gt; but if I was willing to hang around for a while "...the machine will
&gt; probably spit it out."  ...  MBank returns them cut up, you see. ...

Well, that's better than having it hand the card to the next person to use the
machine, anyway.  Actually, my own bank's machine swallowed my card once, for
no known reason (it never even acknowledged that the card had been inserted).
The bank sent me a new card and said the machine cut the card when it claimed
it.  In retrospect, this is probably a good idea — the machine probably
claimed the card because it couldn't read the stripe; I would imagine the
probability of a read failure on a card which has already failed once is
higher than on a card picked at random.  So I'd rather not have a
known-to-be-flakey card, anyway.

Of course, I also have a wife who has a card, so I'm easier about the
time delay than if that were my only access to the system...

This is a follow-up to the article about the woman in West Germany who
incorrectly returned her telephone handset to its cradle after a call to
Africa, generating a phone bill of $1710 for 10 hours.  It was reported here
that the woman was told she could settle for one-third the amount, $570.

  From _World_Weekly_News_, excerpted without permission:

  "The stubborn old widow flatly refused to pay the bill.  Then a
  judge ordered that she need only pay $570.  Still she refused.

  The judge threatened to toss her in the slammer.

  "I said 'OK, go ahead and put me in prison,'" she declared ..  
  " Well, that's what he did.  They took me to jail .. I spent one 
  night in jail.  It was horrible .. The next day they said I could 
  go if I would pay for only five minutes of the call.

  "I said sure I would .. but not a penny more.  Then I came home.
  But I'm still hopping mad !"

&gt; ...the low-tech means that the pilots developed to deal with the problem...
&gt; was to wire a pair of bayonets to the "rails" on either side of the ejection
&gt; seat so that the points projected above the pilot's head.

There are ejection-seat systems nowadays, in fact, that rely on such "canopy
breakers" rather than using a canopy-ejection system.  This does depend on
having a relatively thin canopy; it wouldn't work on the thick one-piece
canopies used on most new US fighters.  But it's certainly simpler and more
reliable than automatic canopy ejection.

Mind you, there is a negative side to having a relatively thin canopy.  There
was a recent accident in Britain, not yet explained in detail, which *might*
have been due to the parachute-deployment system of an ejection seat firing
*through* the canopy by accident (i.e. not as part of an ejection) and pulling
the pilot out of the plane after it.  The plane (a Harrier) unfortunately
kept on flying and eventually ran out of fuel over deep ocean.  Recovering
it will be difficult, but may be tried because more information is badly
needed.

(In case you're wondering why a parachute-deployment system should operate
so violently:  in an ejection at low altitude, getting the parachute out and
inflated *immediately* is very important.)

[As noted in <a href="/Risks/5/72">RISKS-5.72</a>, the NASDAQ over-the-counter computer system was
knocked out of service for several hours on December 9th].  A squirrel
carrying a piece of ALUMINUM FOIL made contact with some electrical equipment
at a electrical substation.  Although there was a power outage in the area,
apparently NASDAQ suffered only a power dip (I assume that they have some form
of backup power) but this power dip was enough to shut the system down [...
for] over 3 1/2 hours before most services were restored.

   [Curses, FOILED again?  Maybe the squirrel was hungry and went for the 
   power DIP (which was SPIKED).   (By the way, this was at least the THIRD
   squirrel power case noted in RISKS — see <a href="/Risks/4/02">RISKS-4.2</a> for two others.)  PGN]

&gt;First of all, there is the classic problem of protected software. We use Sun/3
&gt;workstations, and the first engineering response to problems is swap out the
&gt;processor board (our workstations are single-board).  [...]

Actually, most replacement boards do NOT have an idprom when we receive them
from SUN. SUN highly recommends that you retain your original idprom, which
is what we do.
