In the Business section of the 9/5/90 San Jose Mercury News, Page E-1,
the column "Bits &amp; Bytes", by Rory J. O'Connor and Valerie Rice,
discusses an new class of "Trojan Horse" for PostScript printers.

According to the article, there is a "clip art" file, written in
PostScript, that "surreptitiously reprograms a chip inside the
printers, changing a seldom-used  password stored there. When the
password is altered, ...  the printer no longer functions properly."

A Minneapolis company, Multi-Ad Services is listed as claiming to
have a free "vaccine".

<address>Dave Wortman &lt;dw@csri.toronto.edu&gt;</address>
<i>Thu, 6 Sep 90 15:43:57 EDT</i>
<pre>
I had a very bad experience in trying to configure an Ultrix system
that may be of interest to comp.risk readers.

Most Unix systems are generated from a "configuration file" which
selects optional software to be included in the Unix kernel.
A system utility (/etc/config) processes the configuration file
to build a directory of components for the Unix kernel.  These
components are then compiled/linked together to build a Unix kernel.

In the early (PDP-11) days of Unix, a package for performing emulation
of floating point arithmetic was included in the Unix kernel because
the underlying hardware didn't support floating point arithmetic.
One of the options that can still get included in a configuration file is:

EMULFLT     Emulates the floating point instruction set
        if it is not already present in the hardware

I was browsing through the configuration file for a DEC Ultrix
system and decided in a fit of excessive tidiness to delete the
EMULFLT option.  After all the machine had this expensive
floating point hardware and I would probably gain both space
and performance in the kernel.   The configuration tool built
a system directory without complaint and I was able to compile
and link a new Unix kernel without any error messages.

The trouble began when I tried to boot the new Unix kernel (on a DEC 3600).
One of the first programs that gets run once the kernel has been
initialized is a system utility (/etc/fsck) which validates the root
filesystem by checking all nodes and links for reasonableness.
Under the new kernel /etc/fsck failed with an undocumented error
message and an indication that the root file system was corrupted.
Since this check is deemed to be vital to the correct operation
of Unix, the entire boot process aborted.
Booting an old version of the kernel worked correctly and failed to
discover any problems with the root filesystem.

This was NOT an easy problem to diagnose.
It took a long time and a lot of painful head scratching to discover
that the fsck utility (or some routine that it called) depended in some
subtle way on software that was included by the EMUFLT option (on a
3600 it may have been some complicated string instruction rather than
a real floating point operation) .  Once I restored
floating point emulation to this 4th generation machine, the system
began behaving normally again.

There are several RISK-related lessons to be learned from this
experience:
- one shouldn't casually muck-about with system parameters unless
  one is willing to spend the effort to learn how to adjust them
  properly.
- it is bad system design to document a parameter as an "option"
  when in fact it is mandatory for the correct operation of
  the system.  Until dependencies on floating point emulation
  are brought under control, the user probably shouldn't have the option
  of building a system without EMUFLT and the configuration tool
  should enforce this restriction.
- EMUFLT appears to be misnamed and misdocumented as well,
  it probably causes the inclusion of software other than just
  floating point emulation.
- it is bad system design for a utility program to depend on
  an optional component of its environment without verifying
  that the optional component is available.  /etc/fsck should have
  checked for the presence of floating point emulation and
  displayed an appropriate error message if it was unable
  to continue.

My perception is that they stay fixed, if they were actually fixed.  Usually
they were not properly corrected and, under new circumstances, problems
reappear.  Then it appears as if the bug recurred.  Actually, it had
never gone away.

With regards to wild failure modes of digital versus "continuous performance"
of analog devices, this seems to me a pure fallacy.  Analog devices can display
as great and rapid a change to the system as digital devices.

One of the most graphic historical instances of this is the blackout of New
York City in the '60's.  The blackout, which threw New York into a night of
turmoil, and affected a large portion of the city, was do to one relatively
small power generator in the Chicago area failing "open", what was considered a
benign type of failure.  Unfortunately, New York was connected to the same
power grid, and was a quarter wavelength away.  The distance is extremely
significant, as the power stations in New York received the failure as a
"short".  Massive amounts of power surged through the New York power stations
and destroyed the safeguards along with many of the systems.  Until this event,
no one ever considered it to be a possibility.  No computers involved, small
error action, huge error reaction of an analog system.

This is an example of why much of industry has gone to digital controls.  Yes,
they are complex, but they have discrete, limited numbers of responses.
Modelling simple analog systems is much more complex than modelling a digital
system of similar complexity.  Periodic functions such as those involved in
fluid dynamics (air, electricity, liquids, quantum mechanics, etc) require
analysis in not just time, but frequency domain as well.  Maxwell's equations
are generally not necessary in simulating digital designs, but must be
accounted for in every analog electrical system.

The real issue is complexity, as has been stated by others.  Every technology
which pushes the limits of the implementor's understanding contains the
prospect of unpredicted behaviour.  Digital controls simply have pushed the
limits farther, by allowing the less complex (sometimes read as fewer states)
discrete technologies to succeed the problematic, continuous state analog
technologies.

Pete Mellor and Martyn Thomas agree that

&lt;&gt; You cannot expect crew to do better than their
&lt;&gt; training under the stress of an emergency.

Er...the crew are, after all, thinking humans and merely another set of
automatons in the system.  A recent (past 5 years) air crash in the mid-US was
less disastrous than it might have been precisely because the pilot performed
beyond his training, in a situation which he had not been expected to
encounter.  This is, after all, one of the differences between human and
machine.

&gt;There *are* certification requirements for simulators when they are
&gt;involved in pilot training, [...] However, I think the emphasis has
&gt;been more on precision than on accuracy, i.e. on the sophistication
&gt;and smoothness of the simulation more than on its exact correspondence
&gt;to reality.  [...]

   The fidelity of simulators to their real-world counterparts is
of paramount importance.  It is intended that simulators mimic the
performance of the actual aircraft as closely as possible, so that
techniques learned in the simulator will actually be helpful in the
aircraft.  A tremendous amount of effort goes into confirming the
fidelity of these systems.

   High fidelity of simulation is difficult to obtain and maintain.
Models of aircraft performance may not be perfect, but the errors
may be difficult to detect.  A small variation in simulator behavior
has been suggested as a contributing factor in the crash of a DC-9.
In this case, the simulator produced a visible yaw in the direction of
a failed engine that wasn't present during an actual failure.  It was
theorized by the NTSB that the crew mis-identified the failed engine
BECAUSE they expected the yaw shown in the simulator, and that this
led to a loss-of-control accident.

   Aircraft in the field are often modified, and changes are also made
at the factory.  Thus a given simulator may have at one time accurately
reflected some number of airplanes, but may not be configured identically
to any given airplane currently in use.

   Full-scale simulators are intended to be so like the actual
aircraft that one can be certified to fly the aircraft while only
flying the simulator.  In such cases, fidelity is more important
than reliability —  if the simulator is working, it should
mimic the performance of the aircraft perfectly.  An unreliable
simulator would be more acceptable than one with low fidelity, i.e.
it much more acceptable for a simulator to shutdown and have to be
restarted once an hour than it would for it to run continuously
but incorrectly mimic the performance of the aircraft.

   It should be noted that perfect behavior by a simulator is not
always necessary for the simulator to be useful.  Many low-cost
simulators for light aircraft have some startling performance
artifacts but continue to be effective training aids.  For example,
when the Pacer Mark II simulator is rolled inverted, "up elevator"
still produces a climb.  This is obviously wrong performance, but it
is outside the stated limits of the simulator performance (bank angle
limits are less than 90 degrees).  This particular device has other
interesting artifacts, but it still is useful for certain types of
training activities.  In recognition of its limitations, it is formally
referred to as a "ground procedures trainer", but its function is to
simulate certain modes of flight.

   There is a tradeoff here, just as there is with other technological systems.
Imperfect behavior of simulators may contribute to accidents, but by and large,
their use helps to prevent many more.

Oh, they understand it, all right--they're just encouraged to put a very high
level of faith on it.  It's no wonder that people might become fixated on the
flight director, and neglect the rest of the scan.  In fact, some airline
procedures seem to encourage such a practice, these days.

When one flies a flight director, one is, in effect, flying the airplane like
an autopilot would.  This has the effect of putting the pilot in "the loop,"
but has the problem of having him hanging off the flight director system.


&gt;: critical systems such as simulators - on this evidence, a simulator used for
&gt;: crew training in emergency procedures is *itself* a safety-critical system.
&gt;: (Presumably it should therefore require certification in the same way as an
&gt;: in-flight system of equivalent criticality.

They are certified to a fairly hard standard.  For more information, see
Rolfe's _Flight Simulation_.  He covers the certification, installation, and
testing components of a simulator delivery.  However, also pay attention to how
much of flight simulation is dependent upon specific customer requirements (no
need, for instance, for a motion system, if all the simulator is going to be
used for is systems familiarization) and how much perceptual data is outright
fudged.  Flight simulation is an art, not a science.  When one flies a
simulator, one is flying a concept of how the airplane flies; one is not flying
in a terribly rigorously defined mathematical model.  Even though a simulator
almost always, these days, uses actual airplane avionics, and is almost 100%
component-identical to a real cockpit, the way the instruments WORK is always
subject to refinement.  In the specific case of Northwest vs. CAE, it is
Northwest's responsibility to supervise the development of the simulator, and,
upon delivery, test it to ensure that it met specifications.  Everyone does it
this way; I suspect that Northwest's legal department may have found a legal
technicality to relieve them of their responsibility.

&gt;Does anyone know the certification requirements for simulators?

Rolfe mentions the various certification authorities' requirements.
In addition to these, FAR 121, Appendix H covers the training requirements.

Advisory Circular 120-45 and 120-46 (1987) cover the entire spectrum of
Advanced Training Devices.

Advisory Circular 120-40A (1986) covers simulator and visual systems
evaluation.

Note that all documents are subject to review, as reflected in the Federal
Register; it often takes a couple of years for changes to be reflected in
the "officially" published documents.  Contact your local FAA office for more
info.

Incidentally, I think it's only a matter of time before some bereaved widow
attempts to sue Microsoft, after hubby tries to land on top of the World
Trade Center. :-)

&gt;Synopsis of: Forester, T., &amp; Morrison, P. Computer Unreliability and
&gt;Social Vulnerability, Futures, June 1990, pages 462-474.

&gt;From the synopsis and criticism posted, I have concluded that this work
is probably useless "computer bashing."   On the other hand, the discussion
that it has prompted has been both useful and fascinating.

For example:

In RISKS (10.29), David Gillespie writes:

&gt;I think one point that a lot of people have been glossing over
&gt;is that in a very real sense, computers themselves are *not* the
&gt;danger in large, safety-critical systems.  The danger is in the
&gt;complexity of the system itself......


Nonetheless, the application of the computer adds a great deal of
complexity that might not be there in its absence.  It results,
in part from the complexity of the computer itself, in part
from its inherent generality, and in part, from the failure,
resistance, or reluctance of the programmer to manage it down.

Much of the generality of the computer resulted from the
perception that it had to be broad in application in order to get
copies up and unit cost down.  The early RISC research
demonstrated that this may not be so, but so far we have been
reluctant to employ simple architectures.  For example, we have
known about finite-state machines for a long time, but few have
been successful in the market for any application, much less
safety-critical applications.

Likewise, there has been great resistance on the part of
programmers to give up demonstrably error-prone programming
constructs, such as the infamous GOTO.  (Even using it as an
example is likely to start a new defense.)  Generality and
flexibility seem to be much more highly valued than simplicity.
The result is gratuitous and unnecessary complexity heaped on the
necessary.

Martin Thomas makes an interesting and related observation:

&gt;There is, of course, the related problem of what we mean by
&gt;"getting the design right" and "failure".  In general, these can
&gt;only be defined with hindsight - we recognise that the system
&gt;has entered a state which we wish it hadn't, and we define that as
&gt;failure.  We cannot (usually) guarantee that we have defined all
&gt;safe states, or all hazardous states, in advance.

But part of the problem is that there are an infinite number of
states.  A finite-state machine with a limited number of states
would limit the potential for error.

Thomas continues:

&gt;The question I would ask is: are we making our systems
&gt;significantly more  complex by converting to digital too soon
&gt;(or at all)? Would the system complexity be reduced if, instead
&gt;of converting to digital so that we can use a commercial
&gt;microprocessor, we processed the signals as analog signals,
&gt;using an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) and only
&gt;converted to digital where there is a clear reduction in
&gt;complexity from doing so?

There are two questions here, not one.  The first has to do with
the use of analog vs. digital.  And the other has to do with
"application specific."  Each of these has the potential to
reduce the complexity.  Each should be applied where it is
applicable.

&gt;This is a serious question:  latest technology allows mixed
&gt;analog-digital ASICs, and the cost and time to produce an ASIC
&gt;is competitive with the cost and time to produce the software and
&gt;circuit board for a microprocessor system - and the technology
&gt;is moving so that economics increasingly favour the use of ASICs.

Agreed, but then he continues further:

&gt;YOU CAN HAVE (SOME OF) YOUR FAVOURITE MICROPROCESSORS ON-CHIP,
&gt;TOO.

You sure can, but the favoritism is part of the problem, not the
solution.

&gt;To summarise:  the issue is system complexity - safety is
&gt;related (probably exponentially) to the inverse of complexity (if only we
&gt;could measure it) - SO REDUCING COMPLEXITY IS THE KEY TO
&gt;INCREASING SAFETY; can we make progress by exploiting analog
&gt;techniques?

Perhaps, but there is no question that we can reduce it by
employing finite-state application-specific processors.
