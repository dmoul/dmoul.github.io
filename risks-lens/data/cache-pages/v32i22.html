<p>
The Loudoun County fire marshal determined a faulty lithium-ion battery in a
remote-control car started a fire in Aldie, Virginia, on Friday that
displaced a family of four and caused almost a million dollars in damages.
</p>
<p>
The flames began at about 7 p.m. in the 25000 block of Trilobite Court.
</p>
<p>
Fire and rescue crews from Kirkpatrick Farms, Dulles South, Aldie,
Brambleton, Moorefield, Sterling and Fairfax County were dispatched. One
person suffered minor injuries and about $958,000 of damage was caused, the
fire department said.
</p>
<p>
Lithium-ion batteries power many everyday devices, including smartphones,
laptops, scooters, toys, even cars.
</p>
<p>
Care should be taken when using them to avoid a fire or explosion, according
to authorities.

<p>
Windows 10 comes with a feature called ‘Credentials Manager' that stores
your sign-in information for websites, apps, and also networks, including
the VPN connections. Windows Credentials feature isn't new and it's been
around for a long time, and it is designed to save your login usernames and
passwords.
</p>
<p>
Windows 10 version 2004 has a bug that interferes with Credentials Manager
and it breaks Chrome, Edge, Windows apps, or VPN's ability to authenticate
users or let them sign in to their accounts. Users have also reported that
they are being logged out of their browser or apps every time they restart
their computers.

In 2006 the risk of on-line banking at the customer level included typos in
the payee account number, <a href="/Risks/24/43#subj3.1">http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/24/43#subj3.1</a><i class="shield fad fa-shield"></i><i class="fad fa-flashlight flashlight"></i>
</p>
<p>
Nowadays the scenario is fraud. Alice wants to make a payment to Bob. Eve
spoofs an e-mail to Alice giving Eve's account details instead of Bob's. To
address this problem of <em>Authorised Push Payment fraud</em> the UK introduced
<em>Confirmation of Payee</em> which is an account name-checking service. That is,
Alice when making the transfer, in addition to Bob's banking details, must
also supply Bob's name.
</p>
<p>
A risk of name-matching is reported in the Guardian:

“Personal and company names can be written in a variety of formats,
including initials, middle names, hyphens and ampersands. People who are
known by a nickname or middle name in day-to-day life are likely to have
their legal name on their bank accounts, and the trading name of a firm is
not always the same as the account name.  Systems should be flexible enough
to recognise a broad match with the account number.  […] it's up to banks
how they implement matching criteria, and some are stricter than others.”
</p>
<p>
The newspaper investigated a payment rejected with a message <em>name does not
match</em>. The sending bank used a different format than the receiving bank
expected; in this case, placement of a comma.

“Then you're in trouble. The computer has a long memory.”
  Dr. Charles Dutton (David Wayne), “The Andromeda Strain” (1971)
</p>
<p>
And so do I. In an article I wrote in Risks, Volume 16, Issue 70, dated 03
Jan 1995 titled “Dates and Times Not Matching in COBOL” I discussed problems
with date and time synchronization, i.e., if you collect time in one call
and date in another, how do you prevent the possibility of the date changing
after the time call is made (or the reverse, the time changing after the
date was collected) because of the clock / date rollover at exactly
midnight?
</p>
<p>
The easiest answer is never to run jobs at midnight, but as the saying goes,
“Every hour of the day, somewhere it's midnight.” (And more than this for
the time zones that advance 1/2 an hour.) This may not be an option and you
have to prepare for the possibility, in systems where a request for time and
date are not a single, atomic operation, there is a small probability that
the date could roll over to the next day between the time request and the
date request. Even if the probability is minuscule.
</p>
<p>
In my 1995 article I pointed out how, even then, in interpreted Basic on an
80386DX 40MHZ MSDOS machine, it could make over 3,000 date/time requests in
one second. In Turbo Pascal 6, it could do over 6,000, meaning if this
program was run near midnight every day for eight years (for the Basic
program) or for 16 years (for the compiled program), odds are a date/time
synchronization failure might happen once.
</p>
<p>
Let's say once in 16 years isn't good enough, it has to be pacemaker or
nuclear plant reliable, it can't ever fail. We have to make it that this
solution must be absolutely perfect. And we can.
</p>
<p>
The person I was replying to was worried, that if you wanted
certainty. you'd have to keep doing date/time requests in a loop. I have
since thought of this, and came up with a solution, which requires no
looping, requires one date request, one time request, one comparison, and
possibly a second date and time request. And the two will be
synchronized. And I'll prove it, not just “beyond a reasonable doubt” as is
required for criminal convictions, but “beyond a shadow of a doubt,”
i.e., to an absolute certainty.
</p>
<p>
The assumptions are that a time request, a date request, and a comparison
and branch can all be done in a reasonable period, e.g., completed within
one minute (a typical computer would do all of this in probably less than
1/1000 of a second).
</p>
<p>
Here is the procedure:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Get time.
</li>
<li>Get date.
</li>
<li>If the hour is not 11 (for systems that preformat time to AM/PM) or is
   not 23, exit procedure, date and time are synchronized and nothing more
   needs to be done.
</li>
<li>Get the time again
</li>
<li>Get the date again.
</li>
<li>If the hour is the same as the first time, use the first time and date,
</li>
<li>exit, time and date are synchronized.
</li>
<li>Use the second time and date. They are synchronized.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Why this procedure is absolutely bulletproof:
</p>
<p>
In step 3, if the time isn't 11 (or isn't 23), the date cannot be anything
but the same as the one when the time was collected, so the date and time
are synchronized.
</p>
<p>
In step 6, if the hour is the same in the first and second request, we use
the first time and date request, since the day has not changed between the
previous day request and this time. But the date could have changed after
the second request for the time, so we don't use the second one.
</p>
<p>
In step 7, the hour has changed, but it's no longer 11 (or 23), so the
second date cannot have changed after the second time request (but it could
have changed after the first time request), so we use the second time and
date request.
</p>
<p>
No looping, a simple integer (or 2 character) comparison, in most cases only
1 request for date and time, and in any case, we can know with not just
confidence, but with absolute certainty it's right.
</p>
<p>
It doesn't get any better than that.

A new kit leaves your cryptographic destiny up to 25 cubes in a plastic box.
</p>
<p>
Modern cybersecurity, done with properly paranoid best practices, requires
meeting some tough demands: Carry a physical two-factor key to plug in and
authenticate yourself on a new computer, but if you lose or break that tiny
piece of plastic you could be locked out of your accounts. Use different,
totally unguessable passwords for every website, without repeating them or
writing them down. And even if you opt for a password manager—as you
should—you'll need to remember a long master password for years, or risk
losing access to the rest of them.
</p>
<p>
Or you could reduce all of that complexity to a single roll of 25 dice into
a plastic box. This week Stuart Schechter, a computer scientist at the
University of California, Berkeley, is launching DiceKeys, a simple kit for
physically generating a single super-secure key that can serve as the basis
for creating all the most important passwords in your life for years or even
decades to come. With little more than a plastic contraption that looks a
bit like a Boggle set and an accompanying web app to scan the resulting dice
roll, DiceKeys creates a highly random, mathematically unguessable key. You
can then use that key to derive master passwords for password managers, as
the seed to create a U2F key for two-factor authentication, or even as the
secret key for cryptocurrency wallets. Perhaps most importantly, the box of
dice is designed to serve as a permanent, offline key to regenerate that
master password, crypto key, or U2F token if it gets lost, forgotten, or
broken.

On the day RISK-32.21 arrived in my inbox, <em>The Daily Telegraph</em> carried a
letter commenting that the state of [many of] the UK's roads provides the
chief obstacle to the [safe and effective] deployment of driverless
vehicles. [My qualifications.]
</p>
<p>
The writer points out that: “The system relies on clear road markings … but
temporary ones are left in place long after road works are finished; surface
repairs obscure them, and inner-lane markings are worn out by heavy goods
vehicles.”
</p>
<p>
These aspects are blindingly evident to all observant drivers, but not, it
seems, to politicians and civil servants.
</p>
<p>
But then, an ever-present risk is that those in government live in, see and
experience an entirely different world to the rest of us.

I want to agree with Chris Drewe and push a little further, where he says
“When I'm driving a car, the driving takes my full attention…”  Years ago
I had a competition license entitling me to drive in certain sports car
races. I knew that on the track my full time job was driving.  I also knew
that on the track I was a lot safer than on the public roads: Not only was I
wearing fire-resistant clothing all over, but my car had been inspected for
safety before I was allowed on to the track.  In some ways even more
important was the fact that I could believe all the other drivers knew their
100% full-time job was driving. (And also that they, like me, had passed
real exams, not like the toy ones for state driver's licenses, and their
cars had also been inspected, and that all around the track flags were being
used to tell me of conditions around the next corner…) I have always told
my family and anyone else riding with me that my attention was first and
foremost on my driving, and that I might well go silent in the midst of a
conversation, and if I did they should consider what was going on around us.
</p>
<p>
But cars these days are being built expressly to pull us away from safety.
Yes, lots of neat safety features. But <em>infotainment</em> systems are being sold
both as ways to protect us if we don't pay enough attention, so letting us
think it is OK not to pay attention, and as ways to entertain us and thus
make sure we don't pay attention.  Competition between car makers to see who
can provide us the most distraction moves the industry in exactly the wrong
direction!

“Could” is the operative word.
</p>
<p>
In <a href="/Risks/31/18#subj14.1">https://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/31/18#subj14.1</a><i class="shield fad fa-shield"></i><i class="fad fa-flashlight flashlight"></i>, a summary of FDA MAUDE
reports on product codes for implanted deep brain stimulation devices is
given for the period 01JAN2017-31MAR2019.
</p>
<p>
Coupling signal processing hardware and software to a high-voltage battery
with electrodes, and implantation, may yield unexpected and unpleasant
outcomes.
</p>
<p>
Deaths, injuries, and malfunctions characterize implanted medical device
report events. Inappropriate shocks constitute one type of device life cycle
event tracked by the FDA's Total Product Life Cycle tools
(<a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfTPLC/tplc.cfm">https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfTPLC/tplc.cfm</a><i class="shield fad fa-shield"></i><i class="fad fa-flashlight flashlight"></i>).  Heart
implants (defibrillators and pacemakers) are also known to generate
inappropriate shock events.
</p>
<p>
When a therapeutic shock is delivered to living tissue, it cauterizes in
place at the tissue-electrode interface. The tissue's impedance changes
which can affect programmed therapeutic prescription. The electrode-tissue
cauterization process is sometimes described by the term “electrode
seasoning.”
</p>
<p>
An adjustment—usually in a doctor's office—is performed to correct
device over-sense or under-sense conditions that arise from seasoned
electrode exposure.
</p>
<p>
This MAUDE MDR URL:
<a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfmaude/detail.cfm?mdrfoi__id=10049073&amp;pc=MFR">https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfmaude/detail.cfm?mdrfoi__id=10049073&amp;pc=MFR</a><i class="shield fad fa-shield"></i><i class="fad fa-flashlight flashlight"></i>
(06MAY2020 was the reported event date) describes an implanted
neuro-stimulator (ins) malfunction event. Typical medical device report
event description (submitted by a Medtronic representative to MAUDE on
12MAY2020 and published in MAUDE on 01JUN2020):
</p>
<p>
“It was reported that the ins was showing less than 3 months battery
lifetime with battery level at 82% after 3 weeks being implanted. Device
explant was scheduled, but had not been performed yet. The patient had about
40% symptom relief for their obsessive compulsive disorder (ocd).  There
were high impedances on the left side in a range of 5000-8000 ohms on all
pairs involving contact 0 and monopolar contact 0. Monopolar impedance c/11
on the right side was also high at 2122 ohms. At the time of this report,
the patient was programmed at 3.0 ma, 120 usec pulse-width (pw) and 160 hz
on left side and 3.4 ma, 120 usec pw, and 160 hz on the right side.”
</p>
<p>
Battery depletion from severe electrode seasoning likely prevented
therapeutic stimulus application at the pre-programmed current and
pulsewidth duration. More worrisome, from a patient quality of life
perspective, is this report language: “Device explant was scheduled, but had
not been performed yet.” This means extraction from the patient—more
surgery—is likely. Possibly the device and electrodes, will be replaced
with a new model and electrodes at a new location(s), depending on patient
illness, long-term prognosis, and available alternative therapies.
</p>
<p>
Palliating OCD symptoms with an INS is a relatively new application.
</p>
<p>
A <em>miracle material</em> for implanted electrodes might mitigate impedance
changes by minimizing or eliminating tissue cauterization altogether.  Every
patient will welcome fewer unplanned trips to the doctor, emergency room, or
avoid device explantation due to malfunction or injury.

What privacy?  We never had it on the Net, and even less on smartphones.
</p>
<p>
Last month, Israel's Knesset had approved a law which enables Shabak
(General Security Service, parallel to UK's MI5 and USA's Homeland Security)
to use phone location data for tracking COVID-19 carriers and people who
came into contact with them.
</p>
<p>
An application was ready for download (voluntary, so far) the next day.
This fact, as well as the swiftness in passing the law, indicate that Shabak
has had the ability to do this—and probably has been already doing this
covertly for a long time now; and that MK's are well aware of this.

It might mean this. Reuters reports on 2020-08-13 on initial testing of a
saliva test for CoVid-19 at Sheba Medical Center.

The device has been developed by company Newsight Imaging. The device
irradiates a sample using EM of the wavelength of light, and the results are
analysed. “Machine learning” is used to improve the analysis. No other
technical details are given.
</p>
<p>
“The center said in an initial clinical trial involving hundreds of
patients, the new artificial intelligence-based device identified evidence
of the virus in the body at a 95% success rate.”—whatever a “95% success
rate” means.
</p>
<p>
There are already saliva tests for Covid-19, five of them authorised by the
US FDA under EUA. Yale University has developed one called SalivaDirect,
which received a EUA from the FDA on August 15 or before

Most of them chemically manipulate the saliva constituents. The Israeli test

They say it's in tests, seems promising.. The machine shines light through
the sample and its “spectral signature” is compared with a profile that
seems to be generated by machine learning from prior samples from infected
and uninfected people.  Each test costs about 25c (US), machine costs a few
hundred.
</p>
<p>
I can't tell whether this is real or just gobbledygook.  The Sheba Medical
Center where they're testing it is real, machines are made by Newsight
Imaging, a local startup.  The hyperspectral imaging technology is not new
but the implementation in an inexpensive chip is.

That disease kills more than war isn't at all new or surprising.  The
‘Spanish Flu’ in 1918-19 killed more world-wide than did WWI itself.
Wikipedia says “Of those who died [in the U.S. Civil War], by far the
leading cause of death was disease.”
</p>
<p>
It now appears that the diseases brought to the ‘New World’ by Columbus &amp;
successors killed far more Native Americans than any battles—perhaps 90%
of the Native American population circa 1500 may have been wiped out by
European diseases by ~1700.
</p>
<p>
In more ancient times, even Ghengis Khan's mass murders and genocide
couldn't kill as fast as a garden-variety epidemic.

Agreed. The estimated pandemic v. war death rate multiplier was
heartbreaking to calculate. Proactive public health measures, when widely
embraced by a population, can effectively mitigate pandemics.
