                                (703) 425-6000

                                November 13, 1991

In response to the piece posted by Brian R. Krause on your [inter]national
bulletin board, RISKS Forum, titled "MCI Friends &amp; Family &amp; anyone else with a
touch-tone phone" on October 23, 1991, MCI wishes to post the following
information.

MCI is aware and sensitive to privacy concerns of its Friends &amp; Family
customers.

Additionally, MCI is aware of the isolated incident where its Friends &amp; Family
voice response unit (VRU) Update Line was abused.  MCI has made — effective
November 7 — the access more private by altering the VRU access procedures.

In order to acquire information about a Friends &amp; Family Calling Circle,
customers have two options depending on the information they want.

        Option 1:  Enter the last three digits of your MCI account number to
        receive the status of all Calling Circle members.

        Option 2:  Enter an individual Circle member's 10-digit phone number
        to learn the status of that individual.

We hope this explanation addresses any concerns that may have arisen as a
result of the "RISKS" posting.

 Yesterday's sudden fall in the stock market brought to light a serious
Achilles heel in the way our country's economy is growing.  As panic hit more
and more traders, the faint clatter of computer keyboards added to the fray --
virtual stocks were being virtually sold at an amazing pace.

 It was less of a concern in the 1989 crash, but now we should be even more
aware of the effect computer-assisted trading can have on the market.  Inside
of ten minutes, millions of shares can be unloaded very quietly.

 The securities industry can only grow faster in the coming years; if it
doesn't build some cushions to avoid massive "anonymous" selling, it may be in
for an even more serious down-turn.

In their stock statistics sections, Prodigy has a 14-character maximum
length for the company name.  Apparently, they just chop off any remaining
characters.  This morning, I was surprised to see the following stock among
the ten listed under yesterdays "NYSE Biggest Percent Gainers":

STOCK           LAST            CHANGE          PCT CHG
ELECTRONIC ASS  2 3/8           + 1/4           11.76

(I think this is supposed to be Electronic Associates, ticker EA).

I've completely lost track of what's going on with the gray vs. gorman
"discussion".  I hope you'll put something in the next Risks saying that
further communications on the issue will be conducted through the lawyers of
the parties involved or something to that effect, something that leaves RISKS
out of it!

P.S.  I'm sure this is an example of the risk of computer communication — most
people would post things they wouldn't say to another person standing next to
them.

I greatly appreciated all the supporting mail I received on this topic.  I try
very hard to keep RISKS consistent with the self-imposed standards of being
OBJECTIVE, INTERESTING, PROVOCATIVE, THOUGHTFUL, in GOOD TASTE, and, above all,
INFORMATIVE.  I certainly learned something from both antagonists, and about
them.  Whether or not that was RISKS-RELEVANT or not, I believe that once
something unfortunate has slipped through, it becomes necessary to set the
record straight.  But in keeping with the current efforts to raise the
standards (again) in the continuing epicyclicity of RISKS, there are likely to
be fewer mundanities for a while.  Thanks again to all of you for your
continuing contributions, including those that do NOT get included.  Sorry, I
cannot respond to everything.  So, if you think I missed a GOOD ONE, PLEASE
poke me; I probably did miss it, especially if the Subject: line was
nonspecific.  PGN]

                    Fairmont Hotel, New Orleans

WEDNESDAY, 4 DECEMBER 1991

Welcome and Introduction: 8:45am - 9:00
  Mark Moriconi, SIGSOFT '91 Chair (SRI International)
  Peter G. Neumann, Program Co-chair (SRI International)

Session 1: 9:00 - 10:15, Carl Landwehr, Chair

  Formal Verification of Algorithms for Critical Systems
     John Rushby (SRI International), Friedrich von Henke (University of Ulm)

  State-Based Model Checking of Event-Driven System Requirements

  Open Discussion

Session 3: 2:00 - 3:45, John Rushby, Chair

  The Infeasibility of Experimental Quantification of Life-Critical
  Software Reliability
     Ricky Butler and George Finelli (NASA Langley Research Center)

  PANEL: The Limits of Probabilistic Risk Assessment

     Bev Littlewood (City University, London)
     David Parnas (McMaster University)
     Martyn Thomas (Praxis, Ltd)
     Ricky Butler (NASA Langley Research Center)
     John Musa (AT&amp;T Bell Labs, Whippany, NJ)

    The Butler/Finelli paper argues that ultra-high reliability cannot be
    validated directly from testing, nor can be it demonstrated by appeals
    to software fault-tolerance.  What progress might we reasonably expect
    to make toward numerical risk assessment of life-critical software?

   This session will explain and assess current government regulation such as
   British MoD DEFence STANdard 00-55/56 and various security criteria (e.g.,
   U.S. TCSEC, European ITSEC, Canadian CTCPEC).  What role should such
   standards play?  What should be mandated?
