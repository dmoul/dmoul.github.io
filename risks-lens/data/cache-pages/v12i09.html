The May 27 Aviation Week, reporting on the April 1 test-stand failure of an
upgraded SRB for the Titan 4:

  Investigators determined that extensive three-dimensional computer
  simulations of the [motor's] firing dynamics did not reveal subtle factors
  that they now believe contributed to motor failure.  [Program director]
  Stirling said the full-scale test was essential precisely because computer
  analyses cannot accurately predict all nuances of solid rocket motor
  dynamics.  "That's why we test", he said.

For those who don't follow the space news, a few seconds into the test the
motor pressure rose rapidly and exceeded the limits of the casing, the result
being a large, spectacular explosion that destroyed the motor and much of the
Edwards AFB test stand.

and from Mark Seecof:
  &gt; However, the laws on the books assume the exercise of discretion.

The contradiction is, of course, obvious.  What isn't clear is what to do about
it.

Computers are great at making ``objective'' decisions.  Civil service rules and
government procurement regulations try to mimic this behavior.  The goal is not
to achieve the best, but to guard against the worst.  But even worse can be
``achieved'' when the regulations aren't drafted carefully enough, letting an
unscrupulous official finagle through a particular outcome.

I recently tried to purchase some merchandise at a local Gottschalks with a
check.  Before accepting my check, the clerk checked Shared Check Authorization
Network (SCAN) to see if I have had any returned checks.  The clerk then
informed me that they could NOT accept my check.

Having never bounced a check, and having more than ample money in my checking
account, I was very surprised.

After calling my credit union and SCAN, I was able to sort out the error.
Gottschalks entered the account number on my check BUT NOT the bank number.
SCAN apparently does a look up on just account numbers (as well as account and
bank numbers), and as it turned out, someone with the same account number at a
different bank had bounced checks.  SCAN then returned FAIL.

The result: I could not use a check because someone else at a different bank
bounced a check.

If other places only enter account numbers and not bank numbers, I will
probably have to get a new account number from my bank.  :-(

Don Ingraham was one of the prosecutors who talked at the Conference on
Computers Freedom and Privacy in March.  At the last session, he said he would
write and propose new guidelines for prosecutors to follow that would take into
account the concerns that were brought up at the conference.  Last month, he
gave a talk at the first meeting of the Berkeley SIG on Freedom, Privacy, and
Technology (affiliated with BMUG and CPSR-Berkeley).  He mentioned at that
point that he had a draft, and I later asked him for a copy.  When I asked him
if I could redistribute it, he not only gave me permission, but encouraged me
to do so.

If you have suggestions on how to improve the draft, or if you represent a
relevant group (CPSR, EFF, ACLU, and ACM come to mind) and would like to offer
Don official support, he'd very much like to hear from you.  Don isn't
electronically connected, so you'll have to send him fax or paper mail, or call
him on the phone.  If there is interesting discussion here, I'll tell him about
it, but I don't promise to show him every word.

What follows is first Don Ingraham's summary, then the draft bill, and finally
his commentary on what it means, and what he'd like to have happen with it.
This is an important proposal, and it looks like quite a good law.
                                                                      Chris

               PROPOSAL FOR PENAL CODE SECTION 1538.6:
                   ELECTRONICALLY STORED MATERIAL.

    Revised 11 June 1991
    Donald G. Ingraham, Assistant District Attorney, Alameda County,
    1225 Fallon Street, Oakland CA 94612 4292  (415) 272-6232  fax 271-5157

   The following is a proposal to add to the existing search warrant provisions
of the Penal Code some particular restraints on the issuance of warrants which
are required by federal law; it would also establish controls on the
examination of electronically stored evidence seized in the course of a
criminal investigation, and empower the Attorney General to monitor and
regulate compliance with this law.

There are four main aspects:
   first, it recognizes the existing restraints of federal law, in particular
the Privacy Protection Act (42 USC 2000aa) portion of the Civil Rights Act, and
also chapter 212 of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (18 USC 2700 et
seq) dealing with stored electronic communications.  The portion of the ECPA
which addresses the interception of electronic communications is covered by
existing law.
   second, it establishes the Attorney General of California in a monitoring
and regulatory function, not unlike the function now performed in regard to
criminal offender record information.  In the following text, references to
federal law appear in parentheses.
   third, it establishes criteria for the inventory and analysis of
electronically stored evidence, and affords the person from whom it was seized
and other interested parties standing and information to present their
interests and concerns to the issuing magistrate.
   fourth, it balances law enforcement's necessary investigative authority with
the privacy and personal interests of persons affected by the investigation.

   This topic is of such significance that it is suggested there be a specific
legislative declaration such as this:

 = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

Legislative finding:

    The legislature finds that investigation and prosecution of crimes in which
computers are involved engenders a risk to other rights, including those to
conduct a business, to publish, and to conduct private communications.  This
section clarifies existing requirements of the federal Electronic
Communications Privacy Act and the Privacy Protection Act, and also invests the
Attorney General with authority to regulate the analysis and examination of
electronic media seized under the authority of this chapter.

Addition to Chapter 3, Search Warrants, Title XII, Special Proceedings
of a Criminal Nature, California Penal Code.

Section 1536.5

   A search warrant for computer-related material cannot be authorized except
in compliance with the following restraints.  All electronically stored
material seized, under a search warrant or otherwise, shall be retained and
analyzed as follows:

  [a] if the content is reasonably apparently identifiable as intended for
publication, a search warrant may be authorized only if the affidavit to that
warrant specifically provides probable cause that the material is contraband or
the fruits of a crime or things otherwise criminally possessed, or is property
designed or intended for use, or which is or has been used as, the means of
committing a criminal offense.
     (This is directly from Title 42 USC 2000aa(7).]

  [b] if examination of electronically stored communications indicates that any
particular file is a communication intended to be private and neither party
thereto is named as a subject of the search warrant, and the material has been
in such storage for under 180 days, the investigating officer may not continue
the analysis nor proceed further without obtaining a search warrant for stored
electronic communication, as defined by regulations issued by the Attorney
General.
       (This is adapted from Title 18 USC 2703: the term
        'search warrant for stored electronic communication'
        appears in that Title as a term of art.]

 [c] within five court days of any seizure of stored electronic material, the
investigating officer will file a supplement to the inventory required by
section 1537 which will list all electronic material with all available
specificity, including but not limited to file names then identified, and
indicate what procedures for analysis are being taken.  A copy of that and any
subsequent inventories will be furnished to the subject of the search warrant.
A further supplement will be filed with the issuing magistrate every tenth
court day thereafter until all electronic material has been analyzed.  A copy
of all such inventories will be part of the court record and open to public
inspection.

 [d] Electronic stored media will be analyzed as expeditiously as possible and
in the following order: first, material recognizably necessary to the conduct
of legitimate business and private communications; second, material
recognizably central to the crime under investigation; third, material
reasonably suspected of relating to the crime under investigation.  The
magistrate shall direct the investigating office or prosecutor to return or
copy such material to the owner, providing a receipt for the court record.

 [e] After the filing of the initial inventory, any person who has reason to
believe that he or she would be unfairly adversely affected in business or
communications by the retention or analysis of the seized electronic material
may petition the issuing magistrate for a hearing to demonstrate that the
proposed retention and/or analysis would result in significant injury to a
legitimate purpose.

          [This provision expands upon existing Calif PC
          1538.5, but is specific to electronic media; there
          is no known federal counterpart.  The provision
          for return by DA, receipt to Court, regular
          accounting and standing to others affected is not
          fantasy: we did as much in our Draper prosecution
          with mutually beneficial effect.]

  [f] The Attorney General shall establish regulations for the seizure,
examination, and disposition of electronic material obtained in the process of
criminal investigations consistent with the intent of this section that
intrusion and disruption be as minimal as the requirements of an investigation
permit, and in keeping with federal regulation.

          [This section empowers the Attorney General to
          keep computer related criminal investigations by
          our law enforcement agencies consistent with
          federal law, without the need to go to the
          legislature to accommodate changes in the federal law.]

     Comment, primarily intended for prosecutors, but open to all

  This is the draft of a bill on search warrants for electronically stored
material, which will probably be introduced next session: I need to line up AG
and other support for it to fly.  To put the idea in context, please be aware
that Penal Code 1538.5 covers review of searches and is the basis of our
traverse motions.  It seemed the logical place to put this, rather than in our
Computer Crime section-502- or under privacy.

  The idea is to get a legislative purpose statement, and then flag areas of
concern and potential federal liability:

  (a) flags the First Amendment Privacy Protection Act, 42 USC

2000aa, which addresses : ... any work product materials possessed by a person
reasonably believed to have a purpose to disseminate to the public a newspaper,
book, broadcast, or other similar form of public communication, in or affecting
interstate or foreign commerce.." which I try to boil down by the phrase
"intended for publication", adding a prefatory qualification, that it be
"reasonably apparently identifiable" as such.  The federal act makes no such
allowance, although I cannot imagine a court imposing it: as it now reads it is
rather like forbidding us to open any cabinet that may contain more than one
paper clip, at our peril.

    (b) does the same flagging as to Chapter 212, Electronic Communications
Privacy Act, 18 USC 2700 et seq, again clarifying that it does not apply if one
of the parties is already named in the warrant.  This would assume that the
possibility of electronically stored communications was anticipated by the
warrant, which should always be the case.  The legislative history is barren on
this, but what standing would an intruder have to object?

    (c) through (e) create something new, not in the federal law.  This
basically is a response to the main complaint about the usual investigation,
which is that the gear and files disappear into the maw of the eagle, and are
seldom if ever heard from again.  Having someone say "we're working on it"
every other month is not what I think James Madison had in mind.  I think that
such limbo should not be imposed, assuming that it ever is, and the best way to
keep that from happening would be to require a regular accounting and progress
report.  This would not only be reasonable, but it would also accomplish two
other boons: it would give us a need to keep our investigation going instead of
watching our resources get reassigned, and it should forestall more draconian
controls if this perception gets any more widespread.  We did exactly this when
we prosecuted John "Captain Crunch" Draper, and it worked well.  I wouldn't try
to process evidence any other way.

   (f) would empower our Attorney General to establish regulations for the
search of electronically stored material much as the AG now sets the policies
on confidentiality and privacy of Criminal Offender Record Information/"rap
sheets".  Going by administrative regulation rather than by way of additional
legislation guarantees that we will not stray from federal rules, which should
keep civil rights prosecutions of prosecutors per 42 USC 1983 at a minimum.


    What is needed to bring this about?

    The basic hope is to have it debugged and ready to submit by October: ready
to submit means, among other things, that we have some organized support from
concerned citizens.  The immediate hope is that both law enforcement and civil
libertarians will see the wisdom of structuring what is now not as structured
and be willing to support it.  The idea is to keep it clean and simple; if
glitches later develop, we could amend it again, but the essential aspect at
this point is to get legislative recognition of the fact that search warrants
for electronic material are already different from search warrants for other
things.  If we do that, and can get the Attorney General to agree, it should
fly.  My fondest hope is that come October I could represent to the appropriate
legislator that the AG, the CDAA, the ACLU, the CPSR, and the academic and
business communities thought this a heck of an idea, and in their view
essential.
   In summary, and in particular regard to the concerns of prosecutors like me,
this proposal would avoid the need to develop an electronic privacy measure in
California by adopting the federal law, and giving the Attorney General the
responsibility to keep up with its amendments through the California Code of
Regulations.  Two other states, Utah and Florida, have crafted their own
versions of the federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act; that independent
course risks inconsistencies and uncertainties as the judicial process
construes the ECPA.  The enactment of this proposal would avoid that, while at
the same time providing all available guidelines to law enforcement and to
citizens concerned with the freedom to use computer technology and with
electronic privacy, who are, after all, a significant portion of the People in
whose behalf we prosecutors are privileged to appear.

nation'' by trampling on its residents is once again attempting to reach all
new lows. Now, what has this got to do with programming...?

A bill has passed in the assembly that would require the licensing of computer
programmers — to protect the public interest, of course.  Lord knows the
number of times I've been accosted in pizza parlors, late at night, by renegade
bands of unlicensed programmers. Well, now we'll be able to control these
low-lifes.

If you think I'm kidding, read on. What follows is Assembly Bill A-4414, which
has already passed the assembly. AT&amp;T has estimated that it would need to
license over 5,000 people in New Jersey alone, and there is nothing in the bill
that differentiates home from business use.

So watch out: besides being arrested for legally buying a gun 20 years ago, you
could also be arrested for modifying a DOS batch file!

New Jersey and you. Perfect together?
