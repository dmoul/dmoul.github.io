It is not true that development of computer security principles in the
"defense establishment" has ignored the principle of separation of
duties.  At class B2 of the Orange Book a system is required to support
separate operator and [security] administrator roles.  At B3 and above
it is quite explicit that a) to assume the security administrator role a
distinct auditable action must be taken, and b) that when performing in
that role a person is limited to ONLY doing those things "essential to
performing the security role effectively." Furthermore, there was quite
a long discussion at one of the recent national conferences (I forget
whether it was the last Oakland conference or the NBS/DoD before it)
about the topic of separation of duties as found in the financial
community and how it did or did not relate to the kinds of security
policies "traditionally" found in trusted systems.  One could in fact
argue that the fundamental principle of "need-to-know" versus
"clearance" is a kind of two-man rule:  the person who decides to let me
see a particular classified document, based on his judgement that I need
to see it, is not the same person who grants me the clearance that I
must have in the first place.

On the one hand, I am loathe to assign any sort of serious meaning to
Robocop. It was basically lots of very well done violence with a streak of
humor thrown in. The most thought provoking question I had after seeing it
was "Who in their right mind would trust anything that carried a big gun and
ran MS-DOS?" On the other hand, Ebert's quote clearly ignored the major plot
line of the movie. The guy who was championing ED-209 (The robot that gunned
down a board member during a demonstration) really didn't care if it killed
people. One of his quotes was something to the effect of "I had it all lined
up. Millitary contracts, spare parts for the next 25 years. The profits would
have been great. Who cares if it worked!" Of course the competition for the
ED-209 was a cyborg (half human) which had human judgement and therefore was
much safer... The other great social comment in the movie was the
not-so-overdone "trivialize death and suffering" newscasts.

As for computer risks, there was one lesson to be learned from Robocop. If
you are going to program back doors into an armed robot to protect yourself,
make sure you word your logic strongly enough so you don't get blown away in
the end :-)

In article &lt;8707252233.AA15919@csl.csl.sri.com&gt;:
&gt;The system is designed around four Prime Computer models known as Leopards,
&gt;costing about $750,000 each.  "Prime has had at least five people here full
&gt;time trying to staighten things out," a bank official said.  "This is going
&gt;to be a really slick system, when it works," he added.

A couple of corrections:  The "leopard" was Prime's development name for the
6350.  B of A did not have any in March, since the 6350 had not been announced
and B of A was not a hardware beta test site.  (USC was one of three beta sites
for the 6350, ours was installed in April if I remember correctly.)

(Chances are that B of A got 9955-II's and planned to upgrade.)

Subject:      Nuclear power plant monitoring and engineering
To: RISKS%CSL.SRI.COM@RELAY.CS.NET

Attached, please find some references to applications of computers to
nuclear power plant monitoring and engineering.  A frequent theme is to try
and reduce cognitive overload in the event of a critical situation, i.e.,
present something other than 500 alarms ringing at once.

Works in the control engineering field address this issue in a more general
context: power plants, nuclear plants, chemical plants etc.  A couple of AI
based tools for fault tree analysis which is used in estimating risk
probabilities in the nuclear field among others have also been announced at
various conferences.

For those desiring to track this field, you should watch the American
Control Conference every year and the section for nuclear engineering and
control engineering in the IEEE Computer and Control Abstracts.  This is
very complete: our librarians complain that people keep requesting
references from there that are not in any library in the United States which
makes Interlibrary Loan a tad bit difficult.  It ranges from six months to a
year behind the date of publication unfortunately for the printed edition.

As far as the RISK of an accident, the average number of days of life loss
for nuclear accidents in the United States is on the order of two days per
person.  This uses probabilities estimated by antinuclear power plant
groups.  The number of days lost is a tenth to a hundredth of such risks as
automobile accidents, lighting and the like which we accept on a regular basis.

Hans Mark pointed out that the loss of life from Chernobyl due to delayed
cancers would be lost in the "noise."  That is no statistical test done on
deaths in the Soviet Union could discern that something happened.  If
nuclear power plants were removed and replaced with coal burning plants,
more people would die from the radiation released into the atmosphere by the
burning coal.  This ignores the death toll from coal mine accidents and air
pollution.  In short nuclear power plants are about as risk free as one can
get in this society and our energies are much better off being devoted to
automobile accidents, cigarrette smoking and alcohol addiction.

EG&amp;G Idaho of Idaho Falls has a Reactor Safety Assessment system which
"processes large amounts of data from a nuclear power plant during an
emergency, makes diagnoses, and outliens the consequences of subsequent
actions.  After final refinements, this expert system program is to go on
