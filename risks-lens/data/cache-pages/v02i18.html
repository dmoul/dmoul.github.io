There is also the reverse of the Titanic problem. Sometimes trying to
protect against a particular mode of failure that you are very worried
about actually makes the overall reliability worse. I'm thinking of the
cases where the whole system gets so much more complicated because
"fixing" something pushes it over the edge of well understood
technology.

The aspect of calculating failure probabilities that has always bothered
me is that I can't see any way to take into account the things I have
totally overlooked, the areas that I haven't even dreamed about. You
know, the sort of problem where, after you hear the story, you sigh, and
feel sorry of the people involved rather than thinking that they would
have noticed the problem if they had been a bit more diligent when
testing. Is there any theory in this area?

I've helped track down several very obscure bugs in hardware and/or
microcode. Each time we finally located a problem, I've been amazed at
how easy it was to make it happen. That is after we knew where to poke
and had set up the right test programs. Two examples come to mind.

Ten years ago, I worked on a PDP-10. At one point, the machine was acting a
bit funny. It would run Tenex for days. However, our only big hairy LISP
program sometimes got the wrong answer and the bootstrap loader sometimes
zeroed itself while it cleared memory. One day, the boot loader trouble got
reasonably solid. We wrote a small program to mimic what the it was doing,
catch the trap, reconstruct the test sequence, and try again. It didn't
fail. We included the previous 6 instructions from the loader into our test
sequence. They were doing something totally uninteresting. It failed solidly
- every few milliseconds for an hour while we poked around with a scope. We
finally found a textbook example of a runt pulse. It was happening just when
the end test should decide to stop. (The real problem was a sick power
supply.)

Several years ago, I was doing a lot of Ethernet tire-kicking. The early
Dandelions were coming out of the factory. Everybody was looking for
trouble rather then introducing new problems into their code. Things
felt pretty solid. One evening, I was testing some transceivers. Nothing
interesting was happening, so I connected in another spool of coax.
Poof. Lots of packets started falling through the cracks. Simple tests
worked 100%, but more complicated tests would miss 50% of the packets.
It was a simple timing problem. If a packet started arriving while the
microcode was preloading the transmit FIFO, the microcode/hardware
discarded the input packet as it disabled the transmitter while
switching modes to go inspect the input packet. By inserting the extra
coax, I had increased the delays enough to drop a packet right into the
window.

PS: I second Earl Boebert's recommendation for John Gall's Systemantics.
If only I could remember all his lessons that seem so simple and
obvious while reading about them....

I suppose if I had said to the designer of the Titanic:  "Yes, the worse
maritime accident on record involved the breaching of four watertight
compartments, SO LET'S PLAN ON SURVIVING FIVE," the designer would have
specified smaller compartments, so that the Titanic would have had eighteen,
not sixteen, compartments.  And the iceberg would have ruptured six
compartments...

Some years ago the ARPANet Network Control Center (NCC) at BBN was
tasked to check periodically that each dialup line to each TIPs was in
fact functional.  Absent such a check, a TIP port could be
non-operational for a long time before anyone would notice.

To make the check, a computer at NCC was connected to an outward WATS
line and programmed to call every TIP line around the country
periodically, every week or so, to be sure it could properly connect to
a modem.  For a busy signal or other failure to handshake with a modem,
the program would retry a few times and then alert a human being about a
possible problem.  Then a person at the TIP site would be asked to check
the line there.

All this was OK, and it worked just fine.  Once, however, by some
accident, the computer was connected to an ordinary phone line rather
than to the outward WATS line.  The first indication BBN had about this
disaster occured when the phone bill came, in a cardboard box, with some
three inches thickness of call itemization slips for all those calls.  I
don't remember the total, but I do remember that it attracted a *lot* of
attention at very high management levels.  There was much discussion
about whether the improper phone connection was BBN's error or the phone
company's; I think a compromise was eventually worked out.

A nice check was immediately added to the whole system.  The outward
WATS line had the property that it could be used to call anywhere in the
48 contiguous states except Massachusetts (which is where BBN is).
Thereafter, each night the program placed the first call to a
Massachusetts modem.  If that call worked, the run immediately aborted
and a human was notified that some line other than the proper WATS line
was in use.

A lot of problems are easy to solve, once you know what the problem is.

Modems and calling software should treat as special the case that the
phone on the receiving end goes off hook, but no carrier is detected.
This means either that (1) a person has picked up the phone, or (2)
there is some incompatibility between the calling and answering modems,
or (3) there is a bad connection.  (3) should also be detectable to a
modem (is this true?), so we eliminate it from the special case.  In the
special case the calling software should retry the number a very few
times, then call for human intervention.

Unfortunately, the ultra-standard Hayes Smartmodem 1200 cannot
distinguish between various NO CARRIER conditions at all, much less
distinguish (3) from (1) and (2).  Better (smarter) modems are needed
before the calling software can deal with this special case, and stop
its modems from accidentally torturing people.

While setting up a link to a new system, I entered the phone number
incorrectly.  I failed to connect when the machine attempted to do the
call.  Being very suspect of myself (on the first call), I dialed the
number the machine was attempting to call.  A person answered, and I
attempted to determine the phone number she was at.  This number was
not the same number I was dialing.  I then called the operator (good
old AT&amp;T), and asked what was going on.  The operator dialed the same
number, got the same person on the line, and verified the number was
different.

We worked on the crossed lines problem for 2 days.

The final solution was not crossed lines, but the fact that multiple
numbers connected to ONE phone.

Sadly, neither the operator, nor the person answering the phone, had
any idea that multiple phone numbers went to the same physical unit.

How many phones sit on your desk.  How many phone numbers will it
ring to.  Are you really sure?

Once upon a time, early in the days of my computer-life, I worked late.  I
told my Z-120 to tell my Hayes to call a number.  It did, and I heard the
ring, and then the answer.  No whistle-hiss-CONNECT, but a quavery young
female voice saying, "Hello?... "  I sent three pluses and an ATH to the
Hayes, read the (wrong) number off the screen, and dialed it on my voice
phone.  I wanted to render immediate and abject apologies.  The phone
rang and rang.  I redialed, in case I had incorrectly dialed the wrong
wrong number.  It rang and rang.  I quit.  There was no way to un-scare
that young woman.  I have been much more careful since then - but still
ring a wrong number now and then.  If it is during the day I voice-phone to
apologize.  If it is in the wee hours, I just say a prayer for that person's
serenity, and mine, and go on.

It seems common courtesy to check all supposed "computer phones" by voice,
by day, prior to using them in an auto-dial mode.  The computer doesn't lie
awake at night wondering what wierdo is ringing the phone and hanging up.

In my experience, battery backup for computer systems is usually of
extremely limited capacity (an hour or two) when you're talking about
a large computer center with lots of power-hungry disks and so forth.
Frequently, the amount of battery storage capacity is enough to permit
the system operators to shut down their machines in a graceful fashion,
and requeue any work-in-progress for processing when the AC mains come
back up.  Sites that absolutely require uninterruptable power generally
have backup diesel generators... they're much smaller per kilowatt
than batteries would be, and can run for days at a time as long as you
keep feeding them fuel.

I'm not sure what would happen to the NYSE if there were a two-day
blackout in New York.  There was an extensive blackout (six hours or
so???) back in the 60's, I seem to recall... but it was shorter than
the one that you're speaking of, and the NYSE is probably much more
dependent on computers than it was twenty years ago.  I imagine that
they'd probably have to shut down.

I read a book recently that might be of some interest to Risks readers,
as it addresses the problems of centralized data transmission and storage
to some extent.  The book is "Night of Power", by Spider Robinson;  it's
fictional, borderline SF [by my standards... open to dissent], and
revolves around the seizure of Manhattan Island (and the East Coast's
major satellite uplink) during a social revolution in the 1990's.  The
point was made that the seizure of the uplink could easily have resulted
in a major collapse of the world's interlinked financial systems, if
the data flowing through the link were to be cut off or corrupted.

GAAK! Maybe I'm misunderstanding [Larry Polnicky], or the systems actually
used in the computerized voting booths... but I had always believed that the
voting systems in this country [paper, computer-based, or whatever] were
designed to GUARANTEE A SECRET BALLOT! I've NEVER heard of a public-voting
system that was designed to permit anyone to identify a particular vote, or
set of votes, with a particular voter.  There is a longstanding tradition in
this country of guaranteeing that an individual can vote his or her
conscience, without being identified afterwards as "the person who voted for
Smidget for Congress".

There have been plenty of examples in the past of the problems that can
occur when a person's votes are not kept secret.  Both in this country,
and in numerous countries overseas, people who have voted the "wrong
way" (usually against a clique in power) have been pressured, fired from
their jobs, beaten, tortured, or killed.  I would strongly resist any
computerized (or paper) voting system that would make any votor's voting
record identifiable to *anyone* without that votor's explicit approval.

Note here that I'm not talking about voting systems such as Congress
uses, in which the public has an explicit right to know who voted for &amp;
against what.  In systems such as this, it's fine to have records kept,
and some sort of accuracy/accountability audit... but by their very
nature, these systems are generally much smaller than state-wide or
national voting systems, and are thus less likely to be subject to
large-scale fraud.


    [Even in paper ballot systems, there is usually a serial number which
     provides a back-link from the voter to the ballot.  Otherwise fraud is
     far too easy, with mystery ballots appearing out of nowhere.  But
     recall the earlier Phillipine election in which a local power failure
     downed the central ballot-counting computer, which upon reboot
     immediately finished the ballot counting.  Somebody has to be trusted
     somewhere.  There is a choice as to whom the trust must be given.  PGN]

In response to the DES item, the National Security Agency and other US
intelligence services have conducted numerous signal intercept exercises
throughout the US.  The results of such exercises are for good reasons
classified under national security directives.  Readers Digest, however, which
obviously has good connections, has published several articles during the last
5 years describing the threat from foreign intelligence services as well as
from industrial espionage.  IEEE Spectrum publication had an excellent article,
"Thwarting the Information Thieves," in its Jul 85 edition.

Presently under Fed Standard 1027 DES devices are export controlled items.
This would means that US firms who build such encryption hardware must obtain
an export license before any foreign sale.  Since NSA is the author of the
Standard, their position would seem to be consistent.  IBM of course does sell
and build DES devices, and its personnel developed the algorithm upon which DES
is based.  Therefore, their position would seem to be consistent.
