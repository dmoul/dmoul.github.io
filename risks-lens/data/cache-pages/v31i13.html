The ARD Tagesschau reports that there is a software error in the air-traffic
control system over Germany. They are following up a report by
Deutschlandfunk.

<a href="https://www.tagesschau.de/wirtschaft/flugsicherung-panne-software-101.html">https://www.tagesschau.de/wirtschaft/flugsicherung-panne-software-101.html</a>

The DFS (Deutsche Flugsicherung) uses a system that displays so-called
control strips. The control strips contain information for the air traffic
controllers such as vessel type, route, time of airspace crossing. This
system is not working correctly. The system used in Langen in Hessia is
showing errors, so that the controllers must take more time to inspect what
they are doing. All other systems are said to be operational. This concerns
the airspace from Constance to Kassel and from the French border to
Thuringia.  No other airspaces are said to be affected. Travelers should
expect delays of around 30 minutes.

Airlines had to pay more for two optional upgrades that could warn pilots
about sensor malfunctions. The company will now make one of the features
standard.

"That low-to-the-ground design was a plus in 1968, but it has proved to be a
constraint that engineers modernizing the 737 have had to work around ever
since. The compromises required to push forward a more fuel-efficient
version of the plane—with larger engines and altered aerodynamics—led
to the complex flight control software system that is now under
investigation in two fatal crashes over the last five months.

"But the decision to continue modernizing the jet, rather than starting at
some point with a clean design, resulted in engineering challenges that
created unforeseen risks."

Legacy 737 fuselage design constraints led to MCAS development and
deployment decades later, which apparently caused the deadly aircraft
incidents.

Risk: Legacy system feature preservation for economic motives versus a full
redesign to negate technical debt accumulation.

Hardigree also still maintains that the data Exactis aggregated and then
exposed wasn't actually sensitive, and that the outrage over its exposure
was overblown. He says much of it was pulled from sources like public
records and census data. Exactis combined that public information with data
it traded for and bought, with sources ranging from payday loan and auto
companies to surveys to registration forms for business publications.
Hardigree claims that hundreds of small companies possess similar data.  He
argues that anyone can buy a less refined version of the same collection,
what's known as a Consumer Master File, for around $1,000. "This data is out
there, and it always has been out there," Hardigree says.

But Troy Hunt, the security researcher and data breach expert who manages
HaveIBeenPwned, says that the Exactis data was indeed sensitive enough to
justify the wave of pain that hit the company after its security lapse. He
argues the data is, in fact, sufficiently detailed to contribute to identity
theft, and certainly detailed enough to creep out anyone who finds
themselves in it.

Aadhaar is a 12-digit unique number assigned to all Indian residents. Its
uniqueness is supposed to be guaranteed by the use of biometrics
(fingerprints, iris and photographs). Besides biometrics, the Unique
Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) also collects demographic
information.

Aadhaar is being made compulsory for an increasing number of applications in
India. An extensive household survey conducted by our team [1] revealed
various issues related to this measure, including exclusion problems,
transaction costs, and its impact on corruption.

For example, people experience issues with enrolling [2] for Aadhaar, when
they lose it [3], when they try to link [4] it to the appropriate registry,
when they try to authenticate [5] themselves biometrically, and so on.

More issues are highlighted in this Youtube playlist [6] (not all have
subtitles). The consequences [7] of this range from cancellation or
suspension of benefits, to delays and deaths [8].

A transparency deficit contributes to the EHR catastrophe:

"Entrenched policies continue to keep software failures out of public
view. Vendors of electronic health records have imposed contractual 'gag
clauses' that discourage buyers from speaking out about safety issues and
disastrous software installations—and some hospitals fight to withhold
records from injured patients or their families."

Risk: Missing incentives among stakeholders (equipment vendors, EHR vendors,
medical service providers, physicians, administrators) to align and
standardized EHR content/metadata/coding structures, communications, and
platform protocols. Possibly corrected through better regulation,
legislation, or perpwalks.

<i>March 18, 2019 at 10:15:32 PM GMT+9</i><pre>
William Egginton, Mar 17 2019
No. And high schools shouldn't treat it that way.

<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/17/opinion/code-foreign-language.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/17/opinion/code-foreign-language.html</a>

Maryland's legislature is considering a bill to allow computer coding
courses to fulfill the foreign-language graduation requirement for high
school.  A similar bill passed the Florida State Senate in 2017 (but was
ultimately rejected by the full Legislature), and a federal version proposed
by Senators Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, and Maria Cantwell,
Democrat of Washington, is being considered in Congress.

The animating idea behind these bills is that computer coding has become a
valuable skill. This is certainly true. But the proposal that
foreign-language learning can be replaced by computer coding knowledge is
misguided: It stems from a widely held but mistaken belief that science and
technology education should take precedence over subjects like English,
history, and foreign languages.

As a professor of languages and literatures, I am naturally skeptical of
such a position. I fervently believe that foreign-language learning is
essential for children's development into informed and productive citizens
of the world. But even more urgent is my alarm at the growing tendency to
accept and even foster the decline of the sort of interpersonal human
contact that learning languages both requires and cultivates.

Language is an essential—perhaps the essential—marker of our species.
We learn in and through natural languages; we develop our most fundamental
cognitive skills by speaking and hearing languages; and we ultimately assume
our identities as human beings and members of communities by exercising
those languages. Our profound and impressive ability to create complex tools
with which to manipulate our environments is secondary to our ability to
conceptualize and communicate about those environments in natural languages.

The difference between natural and computer languages is not merely one of
degree, with natural languages' involving vocabularies that are several
orders of magnitude larger than those of computer languages. Natural
languages aren't just more complex versions of the algorithms with which we
teach machines to do tasks; they are also the living embodiments of our
essence as social animals. We express our love and our losses, explore
beauty, justice and the meaning of our existence, and even come to know
ourselves all though natural languages.

The irony is that few people appreciate the uniqueness of human language
more than coders working in artificial intelligence, who wrestle with the
difficulty of replicating our cognitive abilities. The computer scientist
Alan Turing noted that the question of whether a machine can think is
incredibly difficult to determine, not least because of the lack of a clear
definition of `thinking'; he proposed investigating instead the more
tractable question of whether a machine can convince a human interlocutor
that it's human—the so-called Turing test.

One of the important lessons of Turing's test is the reminder that in our
interactions with other people, we are fundamentally limited in how much we
can know about another's thoughts and feelings, and that this limitation and
the desire to transcend it is essential to our humanity.  In other words,
for us humans, communication is about much more than getting information or
following instructions; it's about learning who we are by interacting with
others.

The interpersonal essence of language learning extends to learning as a
whole.  We know that small-group, in-person instruction is more effective
than traditional lectures. We ask questions, are asked in return, and we
learn more, learn faster and retain more when we care about the people we
are interacting with. It's no accident that despite the initial enthusiasm
generated by MOOCs, or massive online open courses, they have in fact been a
major disappointment, with completion rates as low as 5 percent. By
comparison, online courses with smaller groups of students and direct
feedback from the professor show completion rates as high as 85 percent.

  [Furthermore, the types of computer-language skills may be quite different
  from natural-language skills.  For example, computer programming requires
  some intense left-brained activities that learning to *speak* natural
  languages does not, and total-system design and development requires
  synergy between the left-brain and right-brain activities.  (See my
  book chapter,
    Zen and the Art of System Programming: Psychosocial Implications of
    Computer Software Development and Use: Zen and the Art of Computing, in
    Theory and Practice of Software Technology, D. Ferrari, M. Bolognani,
    and J. Goguen (editors), North-Holland, 1983, 221--232.
  However, learning to *write* grammatically in a natural language does
  require more left-brain activity.  Besides, adequate natural-language
  learning (even English for a First Language) seems to be declining
  seriously.  Sloppy use of natural languages seems to be tolerated, whereas
  sloppy use of computer languages is the source of many of the risks in
  RISKS.  The concept of teaching programming as a natural language is
  *really* misguided, for many reasons.  PGN]

NSA FOMO...

Whether you trust Huawei's words or not, at least they give lip service to
"no back doors", which is more than the 5i's will give.

"Huawei, in other words, hampers US efforts to spy on whomever it wants."

"Prism, prism on the wall.  Who's the most trustworthy of them all?"

"Huawei has not and will never plant backdoors.  And we will never allow
anyone to do so in our equipment."

<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b8307ce8-36b3-11e9-bb0c-42459962a812">https://www.ft.com/content/b8307ce8-36b3-11e9-bb0c-42459962a812</a>

The US attacks on Huawei betray its fear of being left behind

Proliferation of our technology hampers American efforts to spy on whomever
it wants

Guo Ping February 27, 2019

As a top Huawei executive, I'm often asked why the US has launched a
full-scale assault on us.  The Americans have charged us with stealing
technology and violating trade sanctions, and largely blocked us from doing
business there.  Mike Pence, US vice-president, recently told Nato of "the
threat posed by Huawei", and Mike Pompeo, secretary of state, warned allies
that using our telecommunications equipment would make it harder for the US
to "partner alongside them."

On Tuesday at the Mobile World Congress, the industry's largest trade show,
a US delegation led by Ajit Pai, Federal Communications Commission chair,
repeated the call to keep Huawei out of global 5G networks.

Washington has cast aspersions on Huawei for years.  A 2012 report by the
House Intelligence Committee labeled us a threat.  But, until recently,
these attacks were relatively muted.  Now that the US has brought out the
heavy artillery and portrayed Huawei as a threat to western civilisation, we
must ask why.

I believe the answer is in the top secret US National Security Agency
documents leaked by Edward Snowden in 2013.  Formed in 1952, the NSA
monitors electronic communications, such as email and phone calls, for
intelligence and counter-intelligence purposes.

The Snowden leaks shone a light on how the NSA's leaders were seeking to
"collect it all"—every electronic communication sent, or phone call made,
by everyone in the world, every day.  Those documents also showed that the
NSA maintains "corporate partnerships" with particular US technology and
telecom companies that allow the agency to "gain access to high-capacity
international fibre-optic cables, switches and/or routers throughout the
world".

Huawei operates in more than 170 countries and earns half of its revenue
abroad but its headquarters are in China.  This significantly reduces the
odds of a "corporate partnership".  If the NSA wants to modify routers or
switches in order to eavesdrop, a Chinese company will be unlikely to
co-operate.  This is one reason why the NSA hacked into Huawei's servers.
"Many of our targets communicate over Huawei-produced products," a 2010 NSA
document states.  "We want to make sure that we know how to exploit these
products."

Clearly, the more Huawei gear is installed in the world's telecommunications
networks, the harder it becomes for the NSA to "collect it all".  Huawei, in
other words, hampers US efforts to spy on whomever it wants.  This is the
first reason for the campaign against us.

The second reason has to do with 5G.  This latest generation of mobile
technology will provide data connections for everything from smart factories
to electric power grids.  Huawei has invested heavily in 5G research for the
past 10 years, putting us roughly a year ahead of our competitors.  That
makes us attractive to countries that are preparing to upgrade to 5G in the
next few months.

If the U.S. can keep Huawei out of the world's 5G networks by portraying us
as a security threat, it can retain its ability to spy on whomever it wants.
America also directly benefits if it can quash a company that curtails its
digital dominance.  Hobbling a leader in 5G technology would erode the
economic and social benefits that would otherwise accrue to the countries
that roll it out early.  Meanwhile, a range of US laws, including most
recently the Cloud Act, empowers the US government to compel telecom
companies to assist America's programme of global surveillance, as long as
the order is framed as an investigation involving counter-intelligence or
counterterrorism.

The fusillade being directed at Huawei is the direct result of Washington's
realisation that the US has fallen behind in developing a strategically
important technology.  The global campaign against Huawei has little to do
with security, and everything to do with America's desire to suppress a
rising technological competitor.

"Choose Huawei for greater security", Says Huawei's Guo Ping

In his keynote address at MWC 2019, Rotating Chairman Guo Ping calls for
global 3rd party assurance to cyber security.

Feb 26, 2019

[Barcelona, Spain, February 26, 2019] Guo Ping, Huawei's Rotating
Chairman, calls for international collaboration on industry standards
and appeals to governments across the world to listen to cyber
security experts.  His requests come during a keynote speech at Mobile
World Congress 2019.

Huawei is the first company to deploy 5G networks at scale, Guo said.
His MWC 2019 keynote address - "Bringing you 5G safer, faster,
smarter" - outlined how Huawei has developed the most powerful,
simple, and intelligent 5G networks in the world, and argued that such
innovation is nothing without security.  He urges the industry and
governments to work together and adopt unified cyber security
standards.

Guo Ping, Huawei's Rotating Chairman, made a keynote speech at Mobile
World Congress 2019.

Summary of MWC 2019 keynote address by Guo Ping, Rotating Chairman,
Huawei:

1. Innovation

Guo used the first half of his keynote to outline Huawei's position as
the global leader in 5G but asserted that security is the basis of the
company's commitment to innovation.

* "Huawei is the first company that can deploy 5G networks at scale.
  More importantly, we can deliver the simplest possible sites with
  better performance."

* "The more we invest in engineering science, the more value we can
  create.  At Huawei, we can bring powerful, simple, and intelligent
  5G networks to carriers anywhere in the world, faster than anyone
  else.  Huawei is the global leader in 5G.  But we understand
  innovation is nothing without security."

2. Security

In the second half of the keynote, Guo responded to recent allegations
directed at Huawei by the U.S. government and called for fact-based
regulation, referring to the recommendations made by GSMA, the
industry organization for mobile network operators worldwide, for
governments and mobile operators to work together.

* "To build a secure cyber environment for everyone, we need
  standards, we need fact-based regulation, and we need to work
  together."

* "To build a system that we all can trust, we need aligned
  responsibilities, unified standards, and clear regulation."

* "I fully agree with recent recommendations: Governments and mobile
  operators should work together to agree upon Europe's assurance
  testing and certification regime.  NESAS is a very good idea and I
  would recommend extending it to the world."

* "Huawei has not and will never plant backdoors.  And we will never
  allow anyone else to do so in our equipment."

* The irony is that the US CLOUD Act allows their governmental
  entities to access data across borders.

FULL TEXT: Guo Ping's Keynote at MWC Barcelona 2019

Bringing you 5G safer, faster, smarter

Ladies and gentlemen, good morning.

It's great to see you all again.

There has never been more interest in Huawei.  We must be doing
something right.

Of course, the past few months have been a challenge for us.  On one
hand, our 5G solutions are widely recognized in the industry.  On the
other hand, there has been a lot of speculation about the security of
our 5G solutions.

Today, I would like to talk about Huawei's latest innovations and our
views on cyber security.

Innovation “ It's all in the details

On the 2018 EU R&amp;D Investment Scoreboard, Huawei ranks number 5
globally.  Last year, we invested more than 15 billion US dollars.

This consistent investment has produced many positive results.
Through nonstop investment, we can keep providing our customers with
new, innovative products and more efficient services.

5G is a perfect example of this.

Powerful.  Simple.  Intelligent.

Huawei is the first company that can deploy 5G networks at scale.
More importantly, we can deliver the simplest possible sites with
better performance.

With 100 megahertz, our 5G can reach more than 14 gigs-per-second;
that's for a single sector.  We are at the leading edge of
performance.

Strong capacity also needs strong transmission equipment.

* If fiber is available, we only need to install a blade, attach one
  fiber, and we can bring bandwidth up to 200 Gbps.  It's incredible.

* If fiber is not available, carriers can use microwave.  However, the
  bandwidth of traditional microwave is only 1 Gbps.  To address this
  problem, we use innovative architecture to boost that bandwidth to
  20 Gbps.

* With our 5G smartphone and CPE, Huawei is able to provide end-to-end
  5G solutions.  We have begun to help carriers deploy 5G at scale.

Proven in field tests and commercial use

Last month, Zealer published a report, saying that Huawei's 5G is 20
times faster than the so-called 5G in the US.  That's in field tests.
In commercial use, it is not 20 times faster, but it's still much,
much faster.  So I fully understand what President Donald Trump said
last week.  The United States needs powerful, faster, and smarter 5G.

In the two charts on the left, we have the results from IMT-2020's
phase 3 tests in China.  As you can see, Huawei is far ahead of the
game when it comes to single site throughput.

The third chart compares the speeds of a commercial 5G network
deployed by several vendors.  This is a real customer network.  On
Huawei 5G, single user speed reaches 1.3 Gbps.

Powerful

Innovation is in the details.

Let's start with capacity.

* For example, with performance algorithm, we can more than triple
  cell throughput.

* For hardware, our 5G chips support 64 channels, the highest in the
  industry.  We have also increased the computing power of these chips
  by 2.5 times.

For microwave, we can support 10 times greater transmission bandwidth
than other solutions on the market.

Little by little, we are pushing the physical limits of our technology.

Simple

We are also making sites as simple as possible, without sacrificing
performance.

For example, if we made 64T antennas with old techniques, one 5G antenna
would be bigger than a door.  Can you imagine installing that?  If we put
one here on the beach, it would be blown down.

To address this issue, we are using new materials.  We have reduced the
number of components by 99%, and with lighter covers, we can reduce weight
by 40%.

These new AAUs are as wide as a backpack and very strong.  They can survive
grade-15 typhoons.  This happened in Shenzhen last year.

Installation is super easy.  We can install them directly on a 4G site, or
even on a lamp pole.  Simple sites greatly reduce carrier CAPEX and OPEX.
In Europe, where space is limited, we can help you save 10,000 euros on site
rental, every site, every year.

Intelligent

In the telecom industry, someone said we are using 5G networks of the 21st
century.  However, network Operation and Maintenance is still in the 18th
century.

Let's look at one figure.  Globally, 70% of network faults are from human
limitations.  To make life easier for carriers, our goal is to build
intelligent networks.

Last October, Huawei launched the world's most powerful AI chips: Ascend 910
and Ascend 310.  We can use these to bring intelligence to all scenarios,
and reduce computing power costs for carrier networks.

Building on these chips, Huawei has developed many algorithms and models for
carrier networks.  With AI, we can increase resource efficiency, make O&amp;M
easier, and reduce power consumption for telecom networks.

Conclusion

The more we invest in engineering science, the more value we can create.

At Huawei, we can bring powerful, simple, and intelligent 5G networks
to carriers anywhere in the world, faster than anyone else.

For the second time in three years, an NCAA basketball tournament bracket
leaked after it was provided to the network that paid to reveal the results.
Among the revelations? UConn is a No. 2 seed.

Mixing business with medicine is ethically horrible.

When healthcare is a business, the more sick people there are (especially
those that need expensive treatments), the more profit there is to be
made. This has many bad consequences:

(1) Managing symptoms is more profitable than curing a disease;

(2) Expensive drugs are more profitable than, for example, recommending
simple changes to diet: so vastly more resources are poured into drug
research than into any other form of cure;

(3) The more unhealthy the population, the more money is to be made.  So
encouraging unhealthy habits is beneficial to a healthcare company.  (It
might be seen as a bit *too* obviously cynical for a healthcare company to
buy a tobacco company and heavily advertise and subsidise tobacco: but there
is a strong business case!)

(4) Tests, tests and more tests! Testing is expensive but can be carried out
on apparently healthy people: so its a good business practice to test for
everything, "just in case".  If you are lucky, you might even discover some
condition that needs expensive treatment.

Contrast this with universal healthcare and government-funded medical
research.  If you are allocated with a certain budget per person and tasked
with improving health you will have a very different set of priorities.

Not having universal healthcare, the U.S. spends around twice as much per
person, compared to other countries, but millions of people still don't have
any healthcare, and overall the population is less healthy than other first
world countries which do have universal health care.

Is it possible that 500 experts can be found in 50 countries who can compile
an 8,000 plus page report to the effect that we are actually managing our
resources as well as we can to accommodate the expanding world population?

Yes, there *is* a risk here: when a scientific hypothesis (with I presume
its obligatory attendant verification-only studies) is taken as a statement
of reality and a political bandwagon is created onto which all sorts of
famous scientists are keen to hop... rational analysis seems to evaporate.

In my experience, science and technology courses do not pay enough attention
to educating students about the philosophy of science... like, who has time
for THAT kind of stuff in a crowded curriculum, right?  That's the real
risk.

... "enabling hackers to activate car alarms, unlock vehicle doors, and
start engines"

In view of another article: "Toyota patents system to dispense tear gas on
car thieves", it's possible to add to this list "if the hacked car is a
Toyota, also spray occupants with tear gas"
