.....  General comments:
*SH Many known security flaws in computer operating systems and application
    programs.  Discovery of new flaws running way ahead of their elimination.  
    Flaws include problems with passwords, superuser facilities, networking,
    reprogrammable workstations, inadequate or spoofable audit trails, ease
    of perpetrating viruses and Trojan horses, improper handling of line 
    breaks, etc.  Examples of UNIX flaws as illustrative.  Lots of internal
    fraud, but external penetrations frequent.
