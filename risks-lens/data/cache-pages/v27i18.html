Jeremy Epstein got me thinking with his blog item—the title says it all:
<a href="https://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/jeremyepstein/how-much-does-a-botnet-cost-and-the-impact-on-internet-voting">https://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/jeremyepstein/how-much-does-a-botnet-cost-and-the-impact-on-internet-voting</a>

Then a colleague pointed out that a really easy botnet attack would be DDoS,
and expressed some skepticism that any US elections org would be able to
deal with it. I agreed on the latter point—I can think of only a handful
of county IT operations with that degree of maturity in IT security
technology, and of course just having the technology doesn't mean that it
always works right. :-|

And on the DoS threat too—of course this easy, as many know including
i-voting pioneers in the government of Estonia, whose i-gov systems were
notoriously DDoSed. So, yes, if the US ever did serious i-voting, there
would be foreign adversaries could well be motivated simply to destabilize
the US gov't by hosing an online election.

But as Jeremy pointed out, there are also classes of adversary whose
motivation would be have a very stable election with an outcome shifted by
an undetected successful cyber-operation. When the target is only a few
thousand votes in a single populous state, then it becomes very attractive
to spend millions of dimes each to own a computer that might be casting a
target vote. (10 cents per bot is the going rate, apparently.)

NOTE TO SELF—When we see botnet operators offering premiums on
geo-location of available nodes, then get *even more worried*.

And, yes, I am not kidding - not kidding at all - this is just one of those
cute national security side-effects of IT security research ... in this case
some DHS funded cyber-homeland-security work to physically map the
Internet. The bad guys will certainly use the results to financial
advantage. Looking to steal a couple thousand i-votes in a US election?
Sure! You want to pay a dime each for 10 million nodes in North America, or
a dollar each for 100,000 nodes in Florida?

Scary.

<i>Sat, 2 Mar 2013 14:20:52 +0000 (GMT)</i><pre>
At about 12.00 noon today Yahoo Mail suffered a major crash of its mail
services when a member of staff apparently invoked a process of
de-activating thousands (if not millions) of accounts.  Subscribers suddenly
discovered that their respective accounts had suddenly become
de-activated. They were asked to re-activate them to regain access. On
entering the required capcha everyone then discovered that Yahoo had deleted
ALL e-mails and folders in those accounts - thousands (millions?) losing
e-mails dating back over 10-15 years.  One member described this as a
disaster for his business in tracking online orders and sales; others opined
that it was a breach of trust in Yahoo systems - after all Yahoo advertise
that e-mails can be 'kept forever.'  This issue brings into disrepute the
concept of cloud storage - that is storing important documents, e-mails and
files on distant servers. When those servers crash or go corrupt or a member
of staff issues a 'delete' or de-activate command then all can be lost.

Many thousands of long term users of Yahoo Mail have had their entire set of
folders and e-mails deleted due to an upgrading snafu on Friday / Saturday
March 1 / 2. This includes even paying Plus members.  It appears that during
the upgrade Yahoo technicians decided to upgrade all Classic users to the
(largely disliked) New e-mail system. Naturally most declined this upgrade
and so Yahoo deleted their entire accounts including all folders, e-mails
going back 10 to 20 years, and contact lists.  I lost 13 years of folders
and e-mails - many from long dead friends.   Many others report losing
important documents, files and correspondence from business and personal
contacts. One used his account to track online orders for running a delivery
business. All have now been lost.  Naturally Yahoo is not contactable via
anything other than a pro-forma. Naturally the pro-forma for restoring
deleted e-mails fails to cater for this emergency.   Many members have
requested restoration of their folders and e-mails. But they only have 24-48
hours to do so. Then all is lost anyway.   I requested a complete
restoration immediately. And like others we received the following
auto-response:

Mail - Messages disappeared, unknown reason [Incident: -deleted-]
Sunday, 3 March, 2013 19:37
From: This sender is Domain Keys verified "Yahoo! Customer Care"
  &lt;customercare-en@cc.yahoo-inc.com&gt;
To: [-deleted-]@yahoo.com
Response
**This is an automated response**

We have attempted to restore your mailbox using the information that you
provided. If some of the e-mails were not restored, it is because they were
not available in the snapshot used.  After we received your request, we
looked for a copy of what your Yahoo! Mail account looked like at a specific
point in time just prior to your requested restore time. Your entire mailbox
(including your Inbox and other folders) will look exactly like it did at
the time the snapshot was taken.

Since we are only able to restore your entire mailbox, there are
some limitations to what we are able to do when restoring:

- We cannot restore any specific message(s) or folder(s).
- We cannot restore any message(s) lost while composing.
- We cannot undo this restoration or restore messages lost because of this
  restoration.
- E-Mails received after the recovery date will no longer be available.
**Please do not reply to this e-mail, as no one will receive your message.**

YET NO FOLDERS NOR E-MAILS WERE RESTORED - ALL HAS BEEN LOST - 13 YEAR'S
WORTH FOR ME, UP TO 20 YEAR'S WORTH FOR OTHERS.  This is utterly
unacceptable. Yahoo has remained silent. Meanwhile it has been opined by
some that Yahoo technicians are staging a protest against their CEO
demanding that they commute to Yahoo HQ to work and not to work at home.

Certainly there are co-incidences of timing. If members do not request a
restoration withing the 24-48 hour gap then restorations cannot be carried
out - period. Apparently Yahoo's backups do not last longer than 48
hours. And the major snafu occurred on Saturday morning (UK-time).

As far as I am concerned - and I hear rumours of others' - there will be
many abandoning Yahoo Mail (and its other services) in the next few
months. Certainly for many this is the final nail in the coffin of using
Yahoo Mail.  C.J.Brady London, UK.

There's this trojan virus going round that is exploiting weaknesses in
Yahoo's security. Basically you receive an e-mail with a single URL to click
on. his sends you to a rogue website which downloads a piece of XLS or
Javascript onto your computer. This then steals your Yahoo login cookies and
sends them to hackers. It also generates similar e-mails and sends them to
everyone in your contacts address book. This is all detailed in posts to
Yahoo Group [Y-Mail] and also at this website:
<a href="http://www.iitp.org.nz/newsletter/article/414?utm_sourceindex">http://www.iitp.org.nz/newsletter/article/414?utm_sourceindex</a>
The question is how to remove this piece of XLS or Javascript? And also how
to avoid getting the damn thing in the first place.  And OK - I know you
shouldn't click on links in e-mails - but folks do. And that's the social
engineering that is being exploited - based on folks collective
gullibility!!

  One way to help shore up defenses would be to improve--or replace--the
  existing certificate authority infrastructure, the panelists said. The
  recent spate of attacks on CAs such as Comodo, DigiNotar and others has
  shown the inherent weaknesses in that system and there needs to be some
  serious work done on what can be done to fix it, they said.

Some of us having been arguing for ages that the existing PKI needs to

It seems to me that rental computers are virtual petri dishes for
identity theft.  However, I don't expect them to spy on me!

Joe Mandak, Associated Press, Pittsburgh, 27 Feb 2013

Spyware installed on computers leased from furniture renter Aaron's
Inc. secretly sent 185,000 e-mails containing sensitive information --
including pictures of nude children and people having sex—back to the
company's corporate computers, according to court documents filed Wednesday
in a class-action lawsuit.

According to the filings, some of the spyware e-mails contained pictures
secretly taken by the rental computers' webcams or other sensitive
information including Social Security numbers, social media and e-mail
passwords, and customer keystrokes, the Federal Trade Commission determined
last year.

The attorneys also claimed Atlanta-based Aaron's hasn't properly notified at
least 800 customers allegedly targeted by spyware made by DesignerWare, a
company located in North East PA.

"We were alerted through the press, via an AllThingsD article, which cited

we had no knowledge of this breach and hadn't been contacted by Facebook,
any other company, or any law enforcement about the potential breach."

A comment on electronic medical record (EMR) system failures, from one
who worked on 1st- and 2nd-generation EMR decades ago ...

Of the flaws reported here:
<a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/entertainment/20130218_The_flaws_of_electronic_records.html">http://www.philly.com/philly/entertainment/20130218_The_flaws_of_electronic_records.html</a>
<a href="http://www.readingchronicle.co.uk/news/roundup/articles/2013/02/16/86796-hospital-ready-to-ditch-30m-computer-system-/">http://www.readingchronicle.co.uk/news/roundup/articles/2013/02/16/86796-hospital-ready-to-ditch-30m-computer-system-/</a>
and elsewhere, many are not about core EMR functions, but rather are
additional features that provider organizations have adopted in addition to
core EMR.

In fact, a big complaint I have about EMR systems (similar to my frequent
rants about voting systems) is that they are large monolithic products with
clever features designed absent customer input, and often require adopters
to change the way that they perform their routine activities. You can
actually say "No, I only want to use the most essential core EMR functions;
please leave out the auto-Rx feature, the scheduling feature, the ..." and
others in addition to those referred to above.

What are the core EMR features? Well, access to medical records, to read
them during a patient visit, and to append to them thereafter. Not Rx, not
scheduling, not lab orders, ... and not lots of other things that might be
sensible to also automate (possibly with a separate application) *after*
core EMR actually worked. The problem with that "if" is that core EMR
adoption is actually quite fraught, and including other stuff makes it
worse.

Here is the original idea from the dawn of time. .... Today, MDs look at a
stack of paper that is part of a patient's record (not all, and maybe not
the part important that day for that patient) before and/or during a patient
visit. They make some notes. Later, those notes are used by medical-records
staff to add to the record. Tomorrow, we will begin the onerous process of
digitizing existing records. When enough of them have been digitized enough,
then we will give MDs the ability to browse and search digital patient
records using a computer, rather than shuffling paper. We will also give the
MD a simple tool to record their notes, in the same essentially unstructured
manner that they do today. Medical records staff will have to continue to
curate MD-generated content, to ensure that an MD's office-visit notes are
incorporated into the patient's record properly, but now
electronically. Over time, we will add new features to help the MD use tags
and templates to reduce the requirement for medical-records staff
involvement, reducing the cost-of-ownership of the product, and justifying
SW license upgrade fees. The MDs run the show, so we'll have to be careful
to make sure these features actually work for the MD. And last but not
least, we can expand the product line with additional products that leverage
the EMR system, that aren't about the record per se, but some other action
that will eventually cause a change to it: referrals, lab orders, Rx, etc.

That was a fine idea for back in the day, but the original dot-com bubble
scuttled it for quite some time. Years later, that fine idea is not what's
happening, for many reasons, but here is the important one: "the MDs run the
show" is no longer true—the green-eyeshades crowd does. So the vendors
make stuff that appeals to the bean counters, without regard for whether it
improves or degrades the MD's provision of services.

  Care to make a comment?  You have the choice of "REGISTERED USERS LOG IN

  Prefer not to register?

  Screen Name *required

  E-Mail (not displayed) *required

  Usernames must be 4 - 20 characters. Registration only takes a few
  minutes. Registered users can also take part in competitions and other
  features of the site.

So much for not registering.

Another weird bit is that the titles of each section are shown in capitals
but actually are normally-cased.  Using cut-and-paste to quote means that
the characters pasted are not those that are actually displayed.
