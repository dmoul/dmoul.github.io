Behind the Lion Air Crash, a Trail of Decisions Kept Pilots in the Dark
By James Glanz, Julie Creswell, Thomas Kaplan and Zach Wichter
Feb. 3, 2019
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/03/world/asia/lion-air-plane-crash-pilots.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/03/world/asia/lion-air-plane-crash-pilots.html</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
  In designing the 737 Max, Boeing decided to feed MCAS with data from
  only one of the two angle of attack sensors at a time, depending on which
  of two, redundant flight control computers—one on the captain's side,
  one on the first officer's side—happened to be active on that flight.
</p>
<p>
  That decision kept the system simpler, but also left it vulnerable to a
  single malfunctioning sensor, or data improperly transferred from it—as
  appeared to occur on the day of the crash.
</p>
<p>
  There is no evidence that Boeing did flight-testing of MCAS with erroneous
  sensor data, and it is not clear whether the F.A.A. did so. European
  regulators flight-tested the new version of the plane with normal sensor
  data feeding into MCAS but not with bad data, the pilot familiar with the
  European certification process said. […]
</p>
<p>
  Older 737s had another way of addressing certain problems with the
  stabilizers: Pulling back on the yoke, or control column, one of which
  sits immediately in front of both the captain and the first officer, would
  cut off electronic control of the stabilizers, allowing the pilots to
  control them manually.
</p>
<p>
  That feature was disabled on the Max when MCAS was activated—another
  change that pilots were unlikely to have been aware of. After the crash,
  Boeing told airlines that when MCAS is activated, as it appeared to have
  been on the Lion Air flight, pulling back on the control column will not
  stop so-called stabilizer runaway.

There's a lot more context in the full article.

The infrastructural humiliation of America
Jon Evans, TechCrunch, 3 Feb 2019
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/03/the-infrastructural-humiliation-of-america/">https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/03/the-infrastructural-humiliation-of-america/</a>
</p>
<p>
I'm flying back to the USA today, and as an infrastructure aficionado, it's
nice to be going home, but I'm dreading the disappointment. I just spent two
weeks in Singapore and Thailand; last year I spent time in Hong Kong and
Shenzhen; and compared to modern Asia, so much American infrastructure is
now so contemptible that it's hard not to wince when I see it.
</p>
<p>
The USA is nine times wealthier than Thailand, per capita, but I'd far
rather ride Bangkok's SkyTrain than deal with NYC's subway nowadays. I'd
much prefer to fly into Don Muang, Bangkok's ancient second-tier airport —
which was actually closed for years, before being reopened to handle
domestic flights and low-cost airlines—than the hostile nightmare that is
LAX. And those are America's two primary gateway cities!
</p>
<p>
So imagine what it's like coming to America from wealthy Asian nations, and
their gleaming, polished, metronomically reliable subways, trains, and
airports. I don't think Americans understand just how that comparison has
become a quiet ongoing national humiliation. If they did, sheer national
(and civic) pride would make them want to do something about it. Instead
there's a learned helplessness about most American infrastructure nowadays,
a wrong but certain belief that it's unrealistic to dream of anything
better.
</p>
<p>
It's not just those two cities. Compare Boston's T to, say, Taipei, or San
Francisco's mishmash of messed-up systems—Muni, where I have waited 45
minutes for a T-Third; CalTrain, which only runs every 90 minutes on
weekends; BART, which squandered millions on its useless white-elephant
Milbrae station—to Shenzhen. And it's not just age; Paris's metro was
inaugurated in 1900, but its well-maintained system continues to run
excellently and expand continuously.
</p>
<p>
Americans still tend to think of themselves as an example to other
nations. Ha. I assure you, over the last few years nobody has flown from
Seoul or Taipei or Tokyo or Singapore or Hong Kong or Shenzhen into Newark
Airport; taken the AirTrain to the NJ Transit station; waited for the
rattling, decrepit train into the city; walked through the repellent
ugliness of Penn Station to the subway; waited for its ever-increasing
delays; ridden to their destination; and finally emerged into New York City
— the nation's alpha city! —still thinking of the USA as anything other
than a counterexample, or maybe a cautionary tale.
</p>
<p>
This goes beyond transport infrastructure. Airport security measures are
much more sensible in Asia. Payments are increasingly separately structured,
and better, too—in many places, credit cards (which already barely exist
as a concept in China) are beginning to slowly wither away, replaced by
Alipay and to a lesser extent WeChat Pay. (Not least because an ever-growing
proportion of the tourist population is Chinese rather than Western,
nowadays.)
</p>
<p>
That's admittedly an example of leapfrogging, not decay, and American
infrastructure does still have some bright spots. American roads are mostly
still superb. Lyft and Uber are much better than their Southeast Asian
equivalent Grab, which, whenever I checked it during this latest trip, was
invariably both slower and more expensive than a taxi (never mind a tuk-tuk)
despite the infamous Thai taxi mafias. International mobile connectivity is
excellent and user-friendly and reasonably priced, at least if you're on
T-Mobile like me, and as an added bonus, due to a technical quirk, mobile
data roaming bypasses China's Great Firewall.
</p>
<p>
But that doesn't change the fact that the state of much of America's
infrastructure is appalling on its face, and even moreso when compared to
nations which are on paper nowhere near as rich. The money other nations
spend on urban infrastructure (don't even get me started on intercity
trains) is instead siphoned off to somewhere else. It makes the USA—still
by far the wealthiest country in the world! —seem like an dying empire,
one beginning to visibly crack and crumble as it is slowly hollowed out from
within.

But Prof. Gus Uht argues that “no public disclosure should be made at all,
until and unless the exploit appears in the wild.” “it can unnecessarily
ratchet up the public's anxieties.” “Better yet, don't even tell the world
that such a thing as a ‘bomb’ exists. Just knowing that something can be
done is enough to drive others to successful re-invention.” [Uh, OK; Truman
should have waited for the “quiet” A-bomb, because the most significant
piece of information that the USSR needed was that once they spent $XXX
billion, the damned thing would actually go off. And we're still

<p>
There are millions of viruses, etc., in the wild today. Countless new ones
are devised by black-hat hackers all the time. In order to proactively
defend against new exploits, some white-hatters seek out or create
weaknesses or vulnerabilities and then devise fixes for them. However, in
some cases, such as Spectre, fixes are not readily apparent, either to the
inventor or the vendor of the target software or hardware. Regardless of
the existence of a fix or not, the question arises as to what to publicize
or disclose about the vulnerability. <strong><em>We argue that no public disclosure
should be made at all, until and unless the exploit appears in the wild.</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
The norm today is to fully disclose vulnerabilities, most often following
the tenets of responsible disclosure. It is our view that this is not the
best thing to do since it effectively broadcasts weaknesses, and thus aids
and abets black hat hackers as to the best ways to compromise systems.
</p>
<p>
With the complexity of current hardware and software systems arising from
billions of transistors and millions of lines of code, it is unlikely that
any system will ever be bug-free or vulnerability-free. There are
effectively an infinite number of unknown vulnerabilities: “Every day, the
AV-TEST Institute registers over 350,000 new malicious programs (malware)
and potentially unwanted applications (PUA).” What then is the point of
actively ‘discovering’ new vulnerabilities and disclosing them? They are
effectively being invented and empower black hats to wreak havoc without
making systems safer. It is a race to the bottom. At the same time <strong>em&gt;it
can unnecessarily ratchet up the public's anxieties.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Pros and Cons: Many arguments for full disclosure have been made over the
years, e.g.: Schneier: Full Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities a ‘Damned
Good Idea’, Hardware Security and references therein, and Reflections on
trusting SGX. However, they all seem to miss the basic point: if you don't
want to be blown up, you don't tell the world how to make and use a bomb.
Better yet, don't even tell the world that such a thing as a ‘bomb’ exists.
Just knowing that something can be done is enough to drive others to
successful re-invention.
</p>
<p>
One argument for full disclosure is that companies will not fix
vulnerabilities unless they are forced to. However, at the risk of excusing
less-than-ideal behavior, looking at the situation from a company's
point-of-view shows that inattention to a fix may be reasonable. There are
a plethora of vulnerabilities and bugs that need to be fixed at any given
time, and resources are limited, so where should such resources be
allocated? Logically, it would be to address the problems having the
highest potential for damage, that is to minimize overall risk. Those
vulnerabilities presenting the greatest risk are those that are widely known
and have large deleterious effects, that is, just those that have been
disclosed and widely publicized.  If a vulnerability has little affect, no
one will care about it and it will not lead the news.
</p>
<p>
Even with responsible disclosure it may be the case that a fix cannot be
made quickly, but the vulnerability inventor decides to fully disclose it
anyway, as in the case of Spectre.  In this case users will be exposed for
possibly a long time, if not permanently.  Without an available fix it seems
irresponsible to disclose such a vulnerability in any way, even
'responsibly.'  Such an apparently indefinite delay occurred with Spectre.
It was fully disclosed in January, 2018, and it was not until mid-Summer
that any kind of effective mitigation that did not severely impact
performance was devised, and then not for all processors.  A
counter-argument can be made that mitigations would not have been devised if
there had not been a full disclosure, since potential mitigation-creators
would not have known about it; however, such mitigations might still have
been too late.
</p>
<p>
Post Mortem: Was/is there a benefit to the Spectre disclosure?  The
implementation of actual exploits is sufficiently complex and
system-dependent that Spectre has not been widely used (yet); see: There is
no evidence in-the-wild malware is using Meltdown or Spectre, Does malware
based on Spectre exist?, oo7: Low-overhead Defense against Spectre Attacks
via Binary Analysis.  We may not be so lucky the next time.  Although
hardware micro-architects are now aware that security needs to be a
first-class design parameter, now black hatters have another vulnerability
dimension to pursue; who knows what they will come up with?  The world has
been shaken up by the disclosure; was that necessary and helpful?
</p>
<p>
We can't always tell what's going to happen upon a disclosure; doesn't that
mean we should be cautious, play it safe, and thus not disclose?  Isn't that
the engineering way of doing things?  But it could be said that disclosure
IS the safest approach, long term, since microarchitectures will be
hardened.  But isn't the short-term risk too great?  We want to be able to
live to see the long-term.  Besides, with possibly billions of affected and
unfixable processors in the world, there would continue to be risks in the
long-term.
</p>
<p>
The Bottom Line: It seems like any attribute, hardware or software, can be
used to detect and affect information or control-processes, it's just a
matter of detailed ‘discovery’ or invention to figure out how.  So let's not
help black hatters speed things up, get there first and really cause
trouble.  Let's just keep it to ourselves.

history, with a valuation of $38 billion, is largely responsible for a grave
new statistic: about 20 percent of teens have admitted to vaping in

When a “difference of diagnostic opinion” arises between the silicon-based
physician-assistant (SiMD) and the carbon-based attending physician (CMD),
how are these conflicts resolved? Will a hospital require a “vote” by
multiple CMDs to overrule the SiMD's? What is the protocol?

If SiMD's can be shown to reduce medical error rates, then their role as an

A leopard seal ate one. And pooped it out. The poop (you can call it scat
if you don't like poop) was collected and then frozen for more than a year.
It was then defrosted and rinsed under a tap to get the big bits out.  One
of the big bits was the USB stick. It was dried out for a couple of weeks,
and they still accessed a bunch of photos.

In his 2008 white paper &lt;<a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf</a>&gt; that first
proposed bitcoin, the anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto concluded with: “We have
proposed a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust.”
He was referring to blockchain, the system behind bitcoin cryptocurrency.
The circumvention of trust is a great promise, but it's just not true. Yes,
bitcoin eliminates certain trusted intermediaries that are inherent in other
payment systems like credit cards. But you still have to trust bitcoin —
and everything about it.
</p>
<p>
Much has been written about blockchains and how they displace, reshape, or
eliminate trust. But when you analyze both blockchain and trust, you quickly
realize that there is much more hype than value. Blockchain solutions are
often much worse than what they replace… […]

Last year, a team of open source developers quietly began loading data for
the entire Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains into Google's big data analytics
platform, BigQuery. With assistance from lead developer Evgeny Medvedev,
Google's senior developer advocate for Google Cloud Allen Day created a
suite of sophisticated software to search the data. In the past year, more
than 500 projects were created using these tools, collectively known as
Blockchain ETL (extract, transform, load), designed to do everything from
predicting the price of bitcoin to analyzing wealth disparity among ether
holders. Day demonstrated Blockchain ETL by examining the so-called hard
fork, or an irrevocable split in a blockchain database, which created a new
cryptocurrency—bitcoin cash—from bitcoin in the summer of 2017. Using
Google's BigQuery, Day discovered bitcoin cash, rather than increasing
microtransactions, was actually being hoarded among big holders of bitcoin
cash.

Apparently, China's AI system for catching criminals is catching the “wrong”
criminals: high-level corrupt officials
</p>
<p>
This is one system that the U.S. should import to watch over our own
government officials—especially those elected to public office and
responsible for all of the government surveillance on ordinary citizens.
Notice how quickly Congress responded to the disclosure of Robert Bork's
movie rental history with the “Video Privacy Protection Act” of 1988.

<p>
SCMP, 04-05 Feb 2019
Is China's corruption-busting AI system ‘Zero Trust’ being turned off
for being too efficient?
</p>
<p>
Despite being restricted to just 30 counties and cities, artificial
intelligence system has already helped snare 8,721 officials
System cross-references big data to evaluate work and personal lives
of millions of government workers.
</p>
<p>
Stephen Chen <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Stephen.Chen.SCMP">https://www.facebook.com/Stephen.Chen.SCMP</a>
</p>
<p>
What would you do if you had a machine to catch a thief? If you were a
corrupt Chinese bureaucrat, you would want to ditch it, of course.
</p>
<p>
Resistance by government officials to a groundbreaking big data experiment
is only one of many challenges as the Chinese government starts using new
technology to navigate its giant bureaucracy.
</p>
<p>
According to state media, there were more than 50 million people on China's
government payroll in 2016, though analysts have put the figure at more than
64 million—slightly less than the population of Britain.
</p>
<p>
To turn this behemoth into a seamless operation befitting the information
age, China has started adapting various types of sophisticated technology.
The foreign ministry, for instance, is using machine learning to aid in risk
assessment and decision making for China's major investment projects
overseas.
</p>
<p>
Beijing has been developing a nationwide facial recognition system using
surveillance cameras capable of identifying any person, anywhere, around the
clock within seconds. In Guizhou, a cloud system tracks the movements of
every policeman with a live status report.
</p>
<p>
Major Chinese telecommunication companies such as ZTE have won government
contracts to develop blockchain technology to prevent the modification of
government data by unauthorised people or organisations.
</p>
<p>
President Xi Jinping has repeatedly stressed the necessity of promoting
scientific and technological innovations such as big data and artificial
intelligence (AI) in government reform.
</p>
<p>
The challenge is implementing that vision on the ground. Look no further
than an anti-corruption AI system dubbed by the researchers working it as
“Zero Trust”.
</p>
<p>
Jointly developed and deployed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the
Chinese Communist Party's internal control institutions to monitor, evaluate
or intervene in the work and personal life of public servants, the system
can access more than 150 protected databases in central and local
governments for cross-reference.
</p>
<p>
According to people involved in the programme, this allows it to draw
sophisticated, multiple layers of social relationship maps to derive
behaviour analyses of government employees.
</p>
<p>
This was “particularly useful” in detecting suspicious property transfers,
infrastructure construction, land acquisitions and house demolitions, a
researcher said.
</p>
<p>
The system is not without its weaknesses, however.
</p>
<p>
“AI may quickly point out a corrupt official, but it is not very good
at explaining the process it has gone through to reach such a
conclusion,“ the researcher said. “Although it gets it right in most
cases, you need a human to work closely with it.”
</p>
<p>
The system can immediately detect unusual increases in bank savings,
for instance, or if there has been a new car purchase or bidding for a
government contract under the name of an official or one of his family
or friends.
</p>
<p>
Once its suspicions have been raised it will calculate the chances of
the action being corrupt. If the result exceeds a set marker, the
authorities are alerted.
</p>
<p>
A computer scientist involved in the programme who asked not to be
named said that at that stage a superior could then contact the person
under scrutiny and perhaps help him avoid “going down the road of no
return with further, bigger mistakes”.
</p>
<p>
The Zero Trust experiment has been limited to 30 counties and cities,
just 1 per cent of the country's total administrative area. The local
governments involved, including the Mayang Miao autonomous county in
Hunan province, are located in relatively poor and isolated regions
far away from China's political power centres.
</p>
<p>
Another researcher involved in the programme said the idea was to
“avoid triggering large-scale resistance among bureaucrats”,
especially the most powerful ones, to the use of bots in governance.
</p>
<p>
Since 2012, Zero Trust has caught 8,721 government employees engaging
in misconduct such as embezzlement, abuse of power, misuse of
government funds and nepotism.
</p>
<p>
While some were sentenced to prison terms, most were allowed to keep
their jobs after being given a warning or minor punishment.
</p>
<p>
Still, some governments—including Mayang county, Huaihua city and Li
county in Hunan—have decommissioned the machine, according to the
researchers, one of whom said they “may not feel quite comfortable with the
new technology”.
</p>
<p>
None of the local authorities responded to requests for comment.
</p>
<p>
Zhang Yi, an official at the Commission for Discipline Inspection of
the Chinese Communist Party in Ningxiang, Hunan province, said his
agency was one of the few still using the system.
</p>
<p>
“It is not easy—we are under enormous pressure,” he said, insisting that
the main purpose of the programme was not to punish officials but to “save
them” at an “early stage of corruption”.
</p>
<p>
“We just use the machine's result as reference,” Zhang said. “We need
to check and verify its validity. The machine cannot pick up the phone
and call the person with a problem. The final decision is always made
by humans.”
</p>
<p>
Since Xi rose to power in 2012, more than 1.4 million party members
and government employees are estimated to have been disciplined,
including leaders like former security tsar Zhou Yongkang and former
Chongqing strongman Bo Xilai.
</p>
<p>
A party disciplinary official in Xiushui county, Jiangxi, who took
part in the Zero Trust project said no government officials were
willing to provide the necessary data.
</p>
<p>
“But they usually comply with a bit of pressure,” said the official,
who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue.
</p>
<p>
Disciplinary officials need to help scientists train the machine with
their experience and knowledge accumulated from previous cases. For
instance, disciplinary officials spent many hours manually tagging
unusual phenomena in various types of data sets to teach the machine
what to look for.
</p>
<p>
Some officials might fabricate data, but the machine can compare
information from different sources and flag discrepancies. It can even
call up satellite images, for instance, to investigate whether the
government funding to build a road in a village ended up in the pocket
of an official, the researchers said.
</p>
<p>
The system is still running in Xiushui, but its fate is
uncertain. Some officials have questioned the machine's right of
access to sensitive databases because there is neither a law nor
regulation authorising a computer or robot to do so.
</p>
<p>
No wonder the system is being decommissioned by counties and cities
that had signed up, and those still using it are facing enormous
pressure, with the researchers seeing little or no hope of rolling it
out nationwide.
</p>
<p>
The Zero Trust hump notwithstanding, artificial intelligence's foray
into other government sectors continues as the government is
determined to apply cutting-edge technology to its advantage. AI
clerks, for example, have been recruited in some courts to read case
files and help judges process lawsuits with higher speed and accuracy.
</p>
<p>
Last month, a court in Shanghai became the first ever in China to use
an AI assistant at a public hearing, Xinhua reported.
</p>
<p>
The machine, code-named “206”, has the ability to record
conversations, show evidence such as surveillance camera footage when
mentioned by lawyers, and compare testimonies to help judges spot
discrepancies, the report said.
</p>
<p>
One judge was quoted as saying it would reduce the likelihood of a
wrong verdict.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) wants to transform the way it tracks
and traces medicines in an effort to protect supply chain security. The road
to achieving that goal runs straight through improved technology, the agency
writes in a regulatory notice. Commissioner Scott Gottlieb even busted out
the “B” word… “We're invested in exploring new ways to improve
traceability, in some cases using the same technologies that can enhance
drug supply chain security, like the use of blockchain. To advance these
efforts, the FDA recently recruited Frank Yiannas, an expert on the use of
traceability technologies in global food supply chains. He'll be working
closely with me on ways for the FDA to facilitate the expansion of such
methods, such as blockchain technology, to further strengthen the U.S. food
supply,” he wrote in a statement. /(FDA

Google and Waze Must Stop Sharing Drunken-Driving Checkpoints, New
York Police Demand
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/nyregion/waze-nypd-location.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/nyregion/waze-nypd-location.html</a>
</p>
<p>
Google's navigation app Waze is known for providing real-time,
user-submitted reports that advise drivers about potential thorns in their
roadsides.
</p>
<p>
But one feature has Waze in conflict with law enforcement officials across
the country: how the app marks the location of police officers on the roads
ahead or stationed at drunken-driving checkpoints.
</p>
<p>
Over the weekend, the New York Police Department, the largest force in the
nation, joined the fray, sending a letter to Google demanding that the tech
giant pull that feature from Waze.
</p>
<p>
In the letter, which was first reported on by Streetsblog, the Police
Department said that allowing people to share the locations of sobriety
checkpoints impeded its ability to keep streets safe.
</p>
<p>
“The posting of such information for public consumption is irresponsible
since it only serves to aid impaired and intoxicated drivers to evade
checkpoints and encourage reckless driving,” the department's acting deputy
commissioner for legal matters, Ann P. Prunty, wrote in the
letter. “Revealing the location of checkpoints puts those drivers, their
passengers, and the general public at risk.”
</p>
<p>
Ms. Prunty added that people sharing the locations of sobriety checkpoints
on Waze might be breaking the law by trying “to prevent and/or impair the
administration” of the state's D.W.I. laws and that the department planned
to “pursue all legal remedies” to stop people from sharing “this
irresponsible and dangerous information.”
</p>
<p>
It was not immediately clear what legal steps might be taken.
</p>
<p>
Waze does not allow drivers to specifically identify sobriety checkpoints.
But people who use the app's police reporting feature can leave detailed
comments on the cartoonish icon of a mustachioed police officer that pops
up.
</p>
<p>
Google said in a statement on Wednesday that safety was a “top priority” and
“that informing drivers about upcoming speed traps allows them to be more
careful and make safer decisions when they're on the road.” …

In spring, 2017, a teenager walked up behind a woman leaving the Metro in
Northeast Washington DC and put her in a chokehold: “Be quiet,” he said. And
“delete your iCloud.” He grabbed her iPhone 6S and ran away.

</p>
<p>
Last month, there were a string of similar muggings in Philadelphia In each
of these muggings, the perpetrator allegedly held the victim up at gunpoint,
demanded that they pull out their iPhone, and gave them instructions:
Disable ‘Find My iPhone', and log out of iCloud.
&lt;<a href="https://web.archive.org/save/https://twitter.com/mattblaze/status/1085607855179382784">https://web.archive.org/save/https://twitter.com/mattblaze/status/1085607855179382784</a>&gt;
</p>
<p>
In 2013, Apple introduced a security feature designed to make iPhones less
valuable targets to would-be thieves. An iPhone can only be associated to
one iCloud account, meaning that, in order to sell it to someone else (or in
order for a stolen phone to be used by someone new) that account needs to be
removed from the phone altogether. A stolen iPhone which is still attached
to the original owner's iCloud account is worthless for personal use or
reselling purposes (unless you strip it for parts), because at any point the
original owner can remotely lock the phone and find its location with Find
My iPhone. Without the owner's password, the original owner's account can't
be unlinked from the phone and the device can't be factory reset. This
security feature explains why some muggers have been demanding passwords
from their victims.

There is a crisis of trust in American democracy.
</p>
<p>
So begins a new report from the Knight Commission on Trust, Media and
Democracy organized by the Aspen Institute. It lays blame on our political
discourse, racial tensions, and technology that gives us all more access to
more commentary and news. “In 2018, unwelcome facts are labeled as fake.”
&lt;<a href="http://csreports.aspeninstitute.org/Knight-Commission-TMD/2019/report">http://csreports.aspeninstitute.org/Knight-Commission-TMD/2019/report</a>&gt;
</p>
<p>
Part of the problem with trust has to do with <em>the ease of cyber-criminals
to ply their trade</em>. Once relegated to a dark corner of the Internet, now
many criminals operate in the public view, selling various pieces of
technology such as ready-made phishing kits to seed infections, carders to
collect credit card numbers, botnets and web stressors to deliver DDoS
attacks, and other malware construction kits that require little to no
technical expertise beyond clicking a few buttons on a web form. A new
report from CheckPoint shows that anyone who is willing to pay can easily
obtain all of these tools. We truly have witnessed the growth of the
Malware-as-a-Service industry.

Many major companies, like Air Canada, Hollister and Expedia, are recording
every tap and swipe you make on their iPhone apps. In most cases you won't
even realize it. And they don't need to ask for permission.
</p>
<p>
You can assume that most apps are collecting data on you. Some even monetize
your data without your knowledge. But TechCrunch has found several popular
iPhone apps, from hoteliers, travel sites, airlines, cell phone carriers,
banks and financiers, that don't ask or make it clear—if at all—that
they know exactly how you're using their apps.
</p>
<p>
Worse, even though these apps are meant to mask certain fields, some
inadvertently expose sensitive data.
</p>
<p>
Apps like Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, Hotels.com and Singapore Airlines also use
Glassbox, a customer experience analytics firm, one of a handful of
companies that allows developers to embed session-replay technology into
their apps. These session replays let app developers record the screen and
play them back to see how its users interacted with the app to figure out if
something didn't work or if there was an error. Every tap, button push and
keyboard entry is recorded—effectively screenshotted—and sent back to
the app developers.

In the wake of the Facetime bug comes news of even more insidious breaches
on your Apple devices. Yes, <em>that</em> Apple, the one that makes so much of
having this “safe” and locked down environment, where you can only run
applications that they have approved, for your own protection.
</p>
<p>
iOS apps are able to scrape screenshots of, basically, everything you do,
and then send that back to, well, whoever they choose.

</p>
<p>
Without asking.
</p>
<p>
Without letting you know.
</p>
<p>
This isn't even a bug. It seems to be part of the iOS system, and could
have valid uses (although what they are escapes me at the moment).
</p>
<p>
The fact that Apple, with it's closed and locked down system, allows this
sort of thing is rather disturbing …

wash my hands ever.”

He doesn't wash his hands because germs aren't real.

Of course, he also says that his lack of hygiene inoculates him, but if germ
theory isn't real, then that doesn't make any sense.

&gt; Debian received a total of 938 CVE's in 2018 with windows 10 only

<p>
I take your overall point, but dispute the validity of this particular
numerical comparison, since Debian contains over 51,000 packages, the vast
majority of which supply functionality Windows 10 doesn't itself offer (such
as two full-fledged office suites—LibreOffice and Calligra Suite—and
multiple e-mail clients). Moreover, even when there is overlap, Debian
commonly offers far more options, with multiple web browsers, media players,
mail servers, etc. This approach makes for a relatively broad overall
attack surface, but individual users and hosts will have more limited
exposure depending on what they actually run.
