New rules against "defaming government agencies," spreading pornography and
violence, and revealing state secrets have been imposed by the Chinese
government.  The rules, which are said particularly to target Internet
users, call for criminal punishment and fines of up to $1,800 for Internet
providers and users who are found to have spread "harmful" information or
leak state secrets via the Internet.  In announcing the rules, China's
assistant minister for public security noted that Internet links had
increased China's cultural and scientific exchanges around the world, but
that "the connection has also brought about some security problems,
including manufacturing and publicizing harmful information, as well as
leaking state secrets."  (Chronicle of Higher Education 9 Jan 1998;

I had a job recently developing a site for an intranet for a division of a
big (Fortune 100) computer company.  As usual, I was working with staff
members to create the kind of web pages they wanted.  One of the things they
wanted was a page of links to related materials.  We were on a tight
schedule, and I wanted to present them with a prototype of the page to
evaluate before all the information was available, so I created the "links"
pages with some dummy URLs.

Throughout the website, I had used the same "placeholder" for missing
information so I could later do a global search across the site to make sure
all the placeholders had been removed.  I used "xxxx" for a placeholder, and
"xxxx.htm" for the missing URLs.  My assumption was that, since "xxxx.htm"
was an improperly formed URL (no http://, and there was no local file called
xxxx.htm), the browser would simply present an error to users when that link
was clicked on.

I never realized how friendly Netscape can be about resolving improperly
formed URLs. It accepted xxxx.htm, and went looking for a site called
www.xxxx.com.  Ooops.

I got a frantic phone call from the company asking if I knew that I had
included links to pornographics sites on my prototype.

The moral: if you must use a placeholder for URLs, include a real, dummy
page on your site, and point those URLs to it.

Is it just me, or do I smell a RISK here?  Winn Schwartau

  ICL is considering using computer-qualified British prison inmates to fix
  computers susceptible to the Y2K problem.  The CEO of Greenwich MeanTime
  suggested that by 1999, ``using prisoners will seem like a good idea and
  even using spotty 14-year-olds will seem reasonable.''  The head of an IT
  worker's union called this inappropriate at a time when ICL is already
  seeking to reduce its workforce.  [ICL Looks To Prisoners To Tackle Year
  2000 Problem, Andrew Craig, TechWeb 8 Jan 1998, PGN Stark Abstracting]

*New Scientist* (8 Jan 1998, <a href="http://www.newscientist.com">http://www.newscientist.com</a>) included an
article saying that a Russian company called Aviaconversia was offering a
4-watt GPS/Glonass jammer for less than $4000 at the September Moscow Air
Show. It says that it could stop civilian aircraft locking onto GPS signals
over a 200 Km radius; military aircraft would be harder to jam, but a more
powerful unit could be built.

The risks (terrorism etc.) are fairly obvious, and it's mentioned that it
would probably be easy to build one even if this company's product is
somehow removed from the market.

According to an 8 Jan 1998 UPI newswire story, Microsoft Corp. will be
working in conjunction with Ford, Volkswagen, and Nissan to install Windows
CE-based PCs in the dashboards of new automobiles.  Quoting from the
article, these 'auto PCs' would "provide voice-activated wireless
communications, electronic mail, games and climate control."

Visteon Automotive systems is working with Ford to be the first to roll out
these new Auto PCs in a production model.  According to Visteon, current car
owners will be able to upgrade to an Auto PC by Summer 1998.

The article goes on to quote Mike Evans, a Ford Truck official, as saying
the new Auto PCs will allow drivers to be "more productive in their
vehicles."

The RISK?  Anyone remember that old joke about "...if Microsoft made cars"?
Well, it looks like it's just around the corner.  And integration of engine
functions with Windows can't be far behind.  I can imagine the tech support
conversations now:

  (tech) "Good morning, MS tech support.  How may I help you?"
(driver) "My PC is frozen, and it's showing a blue screen!  Help!"
  (tech) "Do you have your install CD handy?"
(driver) "Of course not!  I'm stuck on I-90, 200 miles from anything!
          And now my car refuses to start!"
  (tech) "Well, let's see what we can do for you.  Are you sure you've
          been using Microsoft(TM) Gas?"

&gt;
&gt; What really happened on Mars ?
&gt;
&gt;By now most of you have read Mike's (mbj@microsoft.com) summary of Dave
&gt;Wilner's comments given at the IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium.  I don't
&gt;know Mike and I didn't attend the symposium (though I really wish I had now)
&gt;and I have not talked to Dave Wilner since before the talk.  However, I did
&gt;lead the software team for the Mars Pathfinder spacecraft.  So, instead of
&gt;trying to find out what was said I will just tell you what happened.  You
&gt;can make your own judgments.
&gt;
&gt;I sent this message out to everyone who was a recipient of Mike's original
&gt;that I had an e-mail address for.  Please pass it on to anyone you sent the
&gt;first one to.  Mike, I hope you will post this wherever you posted the
&gt;original.
&gt;
&gt;Since I want to make sure the problem is clearly understood I need to step
&gt;through each of the areas which contributed to the problem.
&gt;
&gt;THE HARDWARE
&gt;
&gt;The simplified view of the Mars Pathfinder hardware architecture looks like
&gt;this.  A single CPU controls the spacecraft.  It resides on a VME bus which
&gt;also contains interface cards for the radio, the camera, and an interface to
&gt;a 1553 bus.  The 1553 bus connects to two places : The "cruise stage" part
&gt;of the spacecraft and the "lander" part of the spacecraft.  The hardware on
&gt;the cruise part of the spacecraft controls thrusters, valves, a sun sensor,
&gt;and a star scanner.  The hardware on the lander part provides an interface
&gt;to accelerometers, a radar altimeter, and an instrument for meteorological
&gt;science known as the ASI/MET.  The hardware which we used to interface to
&gt;the 1553 bus (at both ends) was inherited from the Cassini spacecraft.  This
&gt;hardware came with a specific paradigm for its usage : the software will
&gt;schedule activity at an 8 Hz rate.  This **feature** dictated the
&gt;architecture of the software which controls both the 1553 bus and the
&gt;devices attached to it.
&gt;
&gt;THE SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE
&gt;
&gt;The software to control the 1553 bus and the attached instruments was
&gt;implemented as two tasks.  The first task controlled the setup of
&gt;transactions on the 1553 bus (called the bus scheduler or bc_sched task) and
&gt;the second task handled the collection of the transaction results i.e. the
&gt;data.  The second task is referred to as the bc_dist (for distribution)
&gt;task.  A typical timeline for the bus activity for a single cycle is shown
&gt;below.  It is not to scale.  This cycle was constantly repeated.

<pre>
"Fred B. Schneider" &lt;fbs@CS.Cornell.EDU&gt;, in "What really happened on Mars
Rover Pathfinder (Mike Jones, R-19.49)" R-19.53, mentions Lampson and
Redell's 1980 paper.

John Lions' 1977 book "Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition", which contains the
source code for this early version of Unix, and an extremely lucid
examination of that code, has recently been republished (Peer-to-Peer
Communications, ISBN 1-57398-013-7).

Lions (p8-4) comments:
  "Some critical sections of code are executed by interrupt handlers. To
  protect other sections of code whose outcome may be affected by the
  handling of certain interrupts, the processor priority is raised
  temporarily high enough before the critical section is entered to delay
  such interrupts until it is safe, when the processor priority is reduced
  again. There are of course a number of conventions which interrupt
  handling code should observe ..."

The code to which this refers was of the form:

    oldpri = spl7();
    /* critical region here */
    spl(oldpri);

The processor priorities of the PDP-11 were allowed to dictate this
structure to some extent; priority 7 was the highest, and disabled all
interrupts. There was no attempt to set the priority to the lowest
necessary, as the lack of different levels (0, 4, 5, 6, 7 for device
interrupts) meant that 7 was almost always the lowest such level, although
in some cases spl6() was used analogously, that being the clock interrupt
priority. Most local critical regions, such as device drivers, used the
simpler:

    spl5();
    ...
    spl0();

(Here I have used 5 as an example of a known interrupt priority for this
device. All "normal" code ran at a processor priority level of 0, with a
separate software priority and context switching mechanism.)  Clearly
Thompson and Ritchie had thought about and found a way to solve the priority
inversion problem for the limited case of Unix on a single CPU. Their code
predates Lions' commentary by a couple of years at least (1975 or earlier);
I don't know exactly which version of Unix introduced that construction.

SPECIAL ISSUE ON
The Application of Formal Methods in Industrial Critical Systems
Guest Editors: Jorge Cuellar, Stefania Gnesi, Diego Latella

The Journal of Science of Computing Programming has planned a special issue
on the use of formal methods in the industry for the development of critical
systems.  The aim of this special issue is to provide a forum for people
interested in the development and use of formal methods in the industry.  In
particular, this special issue should create a link between scientists
active in the area of formal methods willing to communicate their experience
in the real industrial usage of these methods and people from industry that
are interested to include the usage of formal methods inside their
development methodologies.  This special issue is promoted by the Working
Group on Formal Methods for Industrial Critical Systems of the European
Research Consortium on Informatics and Mathematics (ERCIM -
<a href="http://www-ercim.inria.fr/">http://www-ercim.inria.fr/</a>).  Deadline for submission: 30 Apr 1998.  For
instructions, contact S. Gnesi, CNR - Ist. Elaborazione dell'Informazione,
Via S. Maria 46, I56126 Pisa - ITALY, phone +39-50-593489, fax +39-50-554342
