<p>The 16 Feb 1996 edition of the *Baltimore Sun* announces that a computer program similar to one used to attribute unknown poems to William Shakespeare has been turned to solving the mystery of who wrote the best-selling book, *Primary Colors*. The work
was apparently done by Donald Foster a professor at Vassar College who discovered that both Joe Klein and the author of *Primary Colors* used these adjectives quite often:</p>
<p>especially, entirely, fiercely, incredibly, mortally, particularly, precisely, profoundly, reflexively, relentlessly, seriously, subtly, surprisingly, ultimately, utterly, vaguely, wistfully</p>
<p>More information will be published in an article slated to run in the copy of *New York* magazine that goes on sale on Monday. This article seems to be the major source for the *Sun* piece.</p>
<p>If Joe Klein, a well-known political writer, is indeed the author, it is clear that he didn't learn one of the first lessons of Washington. If you're going to leak information or quotes to the world, make sure you use the diction of your enemy. That's
ventriloquism Washington style.</p>

<p>Intuit Inc. has for the second year in a row delivered buggy versions of its tax-preparation software, TurboTax and MacInTax — which can give wrong entries in cases involving depreciation of cars and real estate, self-employed taxpayers, and IRA
contributions (expected to affect at most 1 percent of their users — 20,000 out of about 2 million). Intuit is offering free updates of the software, and help in workarounds for the old software. Intuit also offered to pay any resulting penalties and
interest charges. [PGN Abstracting. Source: Intuit Finds Errors In Its Tax Software, AP item, *San Francisco Chronicle*, 15 Feb 1996. A similar AP item, Errors Pop Up, Again, In Tax-Preparation Software, *The Boston Globe*, 14 Feb 1996 was forwarded to

<p>Today's Federal Register contains a notice from the Department of State, Bureau of Political Military Affairs, announcing final rule of an amendment to the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR) allowing U.S. persons to temporarily export
cryptographic products for personal use without the need for an export license. The product must not be intended for copying, demonstration, marketing, sale, re-export, or transfer of ownership or control. It must remain in the possession of the exporting
person, which includes being locked in a hotel room or safe. While in transit, it must be with the person's accompanying baggage. Exports to certain countries are prohibited — currently Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria. The exporter
must maintain records of each temporary export for five years. See Federal Register, Vol. 61, No. 33, Friday, February 16, 1996, Public Notice 2294, pp. 6111-6113.</p>

<p>This item appeared in *The Washington Post* two weeks ago; since I haven't seen any mention of it here, I thought I'd send it along.</p>
<p>Wireless Bidder's Inadvertent Zero Could Cost It Millions</p>
<p>...during still ongoing bidding for wireless telephone licenses at the Federal Communications Commission in the District, a Puerto Rican company, PCS 2000 L.P., mistakenly placed a bid totally $180 million for a small market that includes Norfolk and
Newport News, Va. The bidder meant to tap $18 million into the computerized bidding form, but "it is obvious that an extra zero was somehow accidentally added to the end of the bid amount," PCS 2000 official said in a letter to the FCC. ...The FCC imposes
tough penalties on those who withdraw bids, to guard against bidders running up the price of a license and then pulling out. Typically, bidders who withdraw must pay the difference between their aborted bid and the amount of money that the license
actually sells for. ...What baffles FCC officials is that PCS 2000 didn't catch the error. The computerized bidding system gives contestants three opportunities to confirm their bid, followed by a final chance to get a paper printout. PCS 2000 blamed time
pressure: It has been among the most active bidders for the licenses, competing in more than 48 markets in each round. Such typos have occurred three times before, amid the thousands of bids processed by the FCC since it began auctions in late 1994. The
largest error was by a company called Atlanta Trunking, which recently bid $225 million, instead of $225,000, for a radio dispatch license.</p>
<p>The reference to "three opportunities to confirm their bid" leaves open the question of whether the operator is asked to reenter the number or if it's merely displayed for visual checks several times. The chief of the FCC's auctions division also notes
that training seminars and walk-throughs of the process were conducted for the bidders. As of the article's writing, neither firm had been penalized yet, pending consideration of their appeals.</p>
<p>The reporter did not attempt to address the possibility of a breakdown in the bidder's own communications system between any decision-making authority and the agent who actually enters the bid.</p>

<p>*The Washington Post* has reported that a Maryland family received a number<br>
of threatening calls after a University of Maryland student used the Internet to circulate a hearsay allegation that a daughter in the family was being mistreated by her mother. Posting his message on Internet newsgroups concerned with child welfare,
psychology, left-wing politics, and civil liberties, the student urged people to call the mother "at home and tell her you are disgusted and you demand that she stops." The student claims: "You should be able to write what you want on the Internet,
whether it's true or not." (*Houston Chronicle*, 14 Feb 1996, 2A)</p>

&gt; What likely happened is that you accidentally hit Ctrl+Alt+Minus (-)<br>

<p>That's amazing — hitting an easy-to-mistake key combination (considering what you have to hit for non-breaking hyphen and other common non-ASCII codes) puts you in a mode where the next item you select disappears (and apparently without

<a name="subj7.1" href="#subj7.1" id="subj7.1"><img border="0" src="/Images/Misc/flash.gif" width="14" height="14" alt=""></a> CDA interpretation: transmitting vs receiving</h3>
<address>410 
<i>Fri, 16 Feb 1996 08:21:10 -0400 (EDT)</i>
<p>The main provision in the CDA is the prohibition of individuals from "TRANSMITTING" offensive material to other people. In chat rooms it is true that you transmit material; in other words, you type something and it is transmitted to all of the
computers logged into that chat room; however, when material is placed on WEB pages, nothing is transmitted, somebody has to physically search for it and view or download it. This is receiving, not transmitting.</p>
<p>I know this is semantics at this point; but, just because you have an adult bookstore or video store down the street from you doesn't mean you have to go in.</p>
<p>There are utilities that prevent access from URLs with adult content. There are also smart youth out there that can break these with out their (computer illiterate, for the most part) parents knowing. The utilities to prevent access to adult URLs are
getting better; however, parents still have to monitor their children's activities on the WEB.</p>
<p>Preface the last paragraph with the fact that I don't have any children (yet). When my wife and I do have a child and it is old enough to start surfing, the surfing will be in an ocean liner and not a boogie board; I will have to control over the URLs
open to my child until my child reaches the age in which he/she is allowed to enter an adult store.</p>
<p>The risks of all of this is obvious to me:</p>
<ol>
<li>Allowing the CDA to go through eliminates some rights. When one right goes, more follow.</li>
<li>Being computer illiterate allows your children to see material that may be explicit.</li>
<li>Not having a spell checker for VAX E-Mail means that there are probably spelling errors in this.</li>

<p>&gt; "DIR XX?" will show only the second file, but "DEL XX?" will delete both</p>
<p>This is presumably because DEL and DIR do their own filename globbing, rather than relying on a system function to do it for them. I find this highly entertaining, since one of the planks of the Unix-Haters argument has always been that having the
shell do globbing (i.e. all the globbing is in one place) is Evil and Wrong.</p>

<p>As George Kaplan correctly points out, console programs are responsible for carrying out wildcard expansion (i.e. not the shell). However, if memory serves correctly, convention dictates that Windoze programmers use wildcard expansion library routines
that behave in a standardized manner. Unless you enjoy reinventing the wheel and have written your own wildcard expansion routines, every console program should expand wildcards in exactly the same way. Therefore something must be *seriously* screwed up
if "dir" and "del" aren't behaving as expected. Brain dead OS coding (what else is new?).</p>

<p>Exactly this Unix feature has produced a new variant of the wildcard inconsistency: as a program does only see the expanded parameter list, it does not know whether a wildcard string was involved (and if so, which one). Hence, depending on the options
specified, the Unix ls command (the equivalent of the DOS dir command) lists more files than the rm command (the Unix equivalent for the DOS del command) would remove on account of the same wild- card string. Example: ls -lg x* would not only list all
files in the current directory whose names start with an "x", but also all files in any directory whose name starts with an "x".</p>
<p>Sure enough, this is quite better than listing less files than would be deleted, but I still find it disturbing.</p>
<p>In VM/CMS, the program gets the wildcard string, and it can use a central routine (LISTFILE) to expand this string. I think, this is the best solution.</p>

<p>George Kaplan comments that the Unix shell handles wildcard expansion, whereas DOS and Windows programs receive their parameters as typed into the command line, and are left up to their own measures to expand them.</p>
<p>While this is true, there is a standard method for expanding wildcards - the "findfirstfile/findnextfile" functions. (Under DOS and Win16, _dos_find_first and _dos_find_next; under Win32, FindFirstFile and<br>
FindNextFile). Where these commands are used, a uniform expansion of wildcards can be achieved.</p>
<p>There are two reasons that I can see for using a different behaviour, each with their own attendant risks:</p>
<ol>
<li>A lack of education about the appropriate commands, leading people to make their own solutions from more basic functions. Lack of appropriate knowledge usually leads to late delivery dates, slow and bloated software, and often more mistakes - the more
code you have to write yourself, the more chances you have of making a mistake.</li>
<li>A decision to change the interface 'for the better'. As noted below, the wildcard expansion has changed in some ways that might be beneficial - it seems this only applies to some commands, though. The risk here - people are used to the original
interface, and make assumptions based on that knowledge. One of the hardest tasks for a Win3.1 user upgrading to Win95 is to forget many things they learned under Windows 3.1. Frequently this "knowledge" hampers their use of the new features of
Win95.</li>
</ol>
Mr Kaplan might be intrigued, for instance, to note that in a DOS window under Win95, he can place an asterisk in the wildcard _before_ other characters, for example "DIR *MEMORY.H", which will list "VMEMORY.H" and other similar names.
<p>In previous DOS versions, the presence of an asterisk was converted inside the BIOS to a series of question marks, as in my example, which would effectively become "DIR ????????.H" - obviously, for this to work as intended, a question mark must match
an absent character in the file name, hence the behaviour noted in the original article where "DEL XX?" deletes both "XXX" AND "XX". Note that this expansion of the asterisk continues for eight characters - old DOS files are stored with eight characters
of name, and three of extension.</p>
<p>The conundrum presents itself under Windows 95 with the dual nature of a filename. Each filename has a short and long version - when referencing the long version of the filename, it would be infeasible to represent an asterisk as a series of question
marks to the point between the name and extension, since that position is no longer fixed - the name AND the extension may be arbitrary length; indeed, it is only by a stated convention that the extension is the last sequence of non-period characters
following a period (if no period, there is no extension). So, the question mark is no longer forced to have one interpretation.</p>
<p>Experimentation shows that the DIR command seems to be the odd-man-out in Win95, since "EDIT XX?" pulls both files into the editor, for example. In the particular example given, "DIR XX?." (note the period) will list both files. Also, the assumption
that the DIR command will list all files that would be deleted by the DEL command, when given similar parameters, can be proven wrong - simply try a file "XXX.TXT", and type "DIR XXX", followed by "DEL XXX" - the directory listing will show the file,
whereas the delete will complain "File not found".</p>

<p>This difference between MS-DOS and UNIX is a cause of frequent complaint from UNIX users. However, there are technical differences between the two solutions-The UNIX approach requires the ability to pass extremely long command lines to the invoked
commands, whereas MS-DOS is limited (for good reason initially, given the hardware limitations) to about 128 bytes.</p>
<p>The first version of UNIX I used (circa 1975) limited command lines to about 51-bytes — that made the UNIX approach almost useless, because so many<br>
useful expansions required command lines longer than this. It was soon expanded to about 5120 bytes - much better, but still not sufficient on occasion.</p>
<p>There is also a significant effect on the user interface. In MS-DOS, a command like "copy A*.* B*.*" has the effect of copying a bunch of files, renaming them all consistently. A command like this is not possible in UNIX, without requiring awkward
escapes, etc., because the invoked program never sees the original form of the parameters, to make the appropriate substitutions in file names. Whether one likes this or not is a matter of taste, but I think a good argument can be made that the capability
is useful.</p>
<p>I am generally hard-pressed to find good words about MS-DOS, but I don't think it is completely evil :-) (I don't know if there is a RISK here, except perhaps to note again that problems can be trickier than they first appear.)</p>

<p>The recent discussion in RISKS about wildcard expansion lead me to think of another security risk in Unix wildcard expansion. If I were to do a "sz *.zip", someone doing a "ps -aux" on my system would see the list of files<br>
expanded. This could lead to some misunderstandings over what someone was downloading (how often have you had the wrong impression from a filename?).</p>
<p>As well, on a similar topic, my pppd (runs my Linux PPP connections) normally gets the logon and password passed on the command line, causing it to be displayed on a "ps -aux". I realized this, and after doing some researching, discovered I could pass
the p/w from a file instead (which could be 400 root-owned).</p>

<p>TOPS-20 (do I date myself?) was halfway between the UNIX and the Windows '95 approach — it had a JSYS (system call) that would do the expansion, if my memory serves me correctly. So the program determined if wildcard expansion occurred, and if so, all
programs would expand the wildcard in the same way, by issuing the appropriate system call.</p>
<p>I last used TOPS-20 in 1979, so my memory of the exact JSYS used is really shaky. It was a very nice system ...</p>

<p>The commonest VMS command shell, DCL, doesn't expand wildcards either, but VMS provides runtimes for that, and virtually all programs use these. This also applies to command procedures, since the runtimes are accessible at the shell level. The result
is that wildcarding is very consistent under VMS, even though wildcards aren't expanded by the shell.</p>
<p>I gather this isn't the situation under DOS. Imagine my surprise.</p>

<p>Martin Cohen &lt;<a href="mailto:mcohen@nrtc.northrop.com">mcohen@nrtc.northrop.com</a>&gt; wrote about the risk of virtual reality video games in which participants transfer skills, however anti-social, learned in their favorite games to real-world
activities.</p>
<p>A variant on the risk is already apparent. I used to work on Navy research projects and one of our sponsors was actively seeking proposals for research on "trainer sickness." It seems that pilots experience numerous ailments during and after training
sessions.</p>
<p>I've heard of, but cannot confirm, the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>A trainers for 2 crew jets (e.g. F14), in which the visual inputs are geared to the pilot. The pilot can spend a few hours in the trainer. The same visual inputs are askew for the flight officers/navigators, who last only a few minutes before becoming
violently ill.</li>
<li>Pilots who, after an intense training session, experience the illusion/hallucination of accelerated climbing while driving their cars.</li>
<li>Pilots who have "trainer flashbacks" and become ill years after their active training ceased.</li>
</ol>
As I said, I cannot confirm these stories, but heard of them while working on other, unrelated research. Perhaps someone closer to the issue could comment.

<p>&gt;... military aviators were not allowed to operate real aircraft for some &gt; interval after using a VR simulator.</p>
<p>But for a totally different reason. Simulators have become, on the one hand, very similar to reality in the visual domain, but have obvious limitations when it comes to simulating movement. (If you integrate all the accelerations your simulated plane
seems to be doing, you end up traveling the distance the plane would be doing if it were actually flying, which is a tad bothersome for a stationary simulator...) Thus, that part of your inner ear that measures acceleration is only briefly stimulated by
the start of a movement in the simulator; the rest is done visually, which works because the visual system, having acquired extensive real-world experience, is capable of generating the same sensations as real accelerations (ever seen the IMAX versions of
those nice JPL-produced Venus and Mars flyovers?). However, your neural system is capable of learning, and quickly at that: In a flight simulator, and especially a military one where manoeuvers are much more extreme than for a civilian craft, the pilot
learns within an hour to associate visual movement with only very little input from the inner ear. When he next happens to accelerate in the real world (and it reportedly has happened just quickly walking down a stair after the simulator session) his
system revolts 8-) because of the cognitive dissonance caused by conflicting actual input and experience. Not a good idea at Mach 0.8 and 50 meters above the tree tops... Fortunately, one un-learns (or, rather re-learns) within a day or two.</p>

<p>It struck me after reading the article that 'Realistic virtuality' may be a better term than 'virtual reality'.</p>
<p>I think the risks as listed by Cohen are obvious, but is not so obvious is the perception that 'virtual reality' is in some way linked to 'reality'. It gives the illusion of being 'real' in that it is realistic but it is only virtual and the virtual
world is at the whim of the creator of that world.</p>

<p>Having grown up in the 80's and still being a somewhat avid video gamer, I can attest to both the advantages and risks of habits gained in VR-like situations. It is common for me to drive 30 miles to my home after an intense hour long multi-player
DESCENT(*) session, during which, my nerves are *still* on alert from the game. At these times, I am more alert and aware of my surroundings, however, my Jeep doesn't have the ability to fire homing missiles and take off vertically at mach-3.</p>
<p>I think the overall result, though, is that after being in VR-like (or traditional video game) situations, the individual winds up with better motion-perception ability. I think this sticks while the learned reactions (fire the homing missiles,
Gunner!) are left in the fantasy world.</p>
<address>Rob</address>
(*) DESCENT for those of you who do not know is a single or multi-player 3-D shoot-em-up, where you pilot a spacecraft within the shafts of deep-space mines. You have a plethora of weaponry available to you, and-- in multi-player mode-- it gives you the
opportunity to blast your co-workers to space dust. More information can be found at <a href="http://www.idsoftware.com">http://www.idsoftware.com</a>
