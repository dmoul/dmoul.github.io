BREAKING NEWS

This article features my thoughts on the recent Florida Election recounts:

This is actually the *third* time where ballot layouts in certain Florida
counties may have confused voters. Here's a detailed report about the 1988

WASHINGTON - Habersham County's Mud Creek precinct in northeastern Georgia
had 276 registered voters ahead of the state's primary elections in May.

But 670 ballots were cast, according to the Georgia secretary of state's
office, indicating a 243 percent turnout.  Georgia is one of four states
that uses voting machines statewide that produce no paper record for voters
to verify, making them difficult to audit, experts say.

  Difficult indeed. Coincidentally (we hope), 83% of the county vote was for
  the outgoing secretary of state Kemp.

  It really only takes one story like this to prove the larger proposition
  that unauditable electronic voting machines are a menace to
  democracy. Only obvious errors like this bubble to the surface; who knows
  what goes on in other cases?

Voting Machine Manual Instructed Election Officials to Use Weak Passwords

A vendor manual for voting machines used in about ten states shows the
vendor instructed customers to use trivial easy-to-crack passwords and to
re-use the passwords when changing log-in credentials.

States and counties have had two years since the 2016 presidential election
to educate themselves about security best practices and to fix security
vulnerabilities in their election systems and processes. But despite
widespread concerns about election interference from state-sponsored hackers
in Russia and elsewhere, apparently not everyone received the memo about
security, or read it.

An election security expert who has done risk-assessments in several states
since 2016 recently found a reference manual that appears to have been
created by one voting machine vendor for county election officials and that
lists critical usernames and passwords for the vendor's tabulation system.
The passwords, including a system administrator and root password, are
trivial and easy to crack, including one composed from the vendor's name.
And although the document indicates that customers will be prompted
periodically by the system to change the passwords, the document instructs
customers to re-use passwords in some cases—alternating between two of
them—and in other cases to simply change a number appended to the end of
some passwords to change them.

Most things don't happen the way they do in the movies. Changes are less
sudden, incidents less surprising, humans less attractive. But when a
runaway train tore through the Australian outback, the action sequence that
followed seems to have come right out of a Tony Scott flick.

The whole mess started when the engineer stopped the 268-car,
four-locomotive train and hopped out to inspect one of the cars, according
to the Australian Transport Safety Board. While he was on the ground
(presumably distracted by giant spiders and roving kangaroos), the train
pulled away with nobody on board. Loaded down with iron ore, it was soon
hitting 68 mph. The train, operated by metals, mining, and petroleum giant
BHP, covered a remarkable 57 miles before the company stopped it--by
flinging it off the tracks.

Nobody was hurt, though the investigators, who are working to determine why
the train pulled away in the first place, rated the damage to the equipment
as `substantial'.  ...

Here's one spot of good news: The technology to prevent an extended runaway
train incident like this one already exists. Positive Train Control systems
use train- and rail-mounted GPS and sensors to track locomotive movement and
alert conductors and dispatchers to imminent derailments or collisions. If
humans don't react to the warnings, the systems are designed to
automatically brake trains before something terrible goes
down. Congressional legislation demanded that America's rail operators
implement Positive Train Control by 2015, but the Department of
Transportation extended the deadline to December 2018 after many struggled
to deploy the technology in time. According to the DOT's Positive Train
Control dashboard, just 18 of 40 railroads had PTC implemented on all their
locomotives by July of this year.

"Ghosn also acknowledged a big barrier to innovation: regulations and
clearing any obstacles they raise before mass-marketing. This is more than
just a caveat. Legal questions from traffic rules to liability in an
accident ultimately will determine whether consumers—be they big
corporations or individuals—decide if they can live with driverless cars,
or can't live without them."

"Removing the driver reduces a company's cost of goods by as much as 90
percent, he said."

Risk: Cross-border compliance with traffic rules complicates AV deployment
and elevates safety underachievement potential without a binding
international treaty. Especially critical for freight delivery services.

Unwise to rely on GPS signal to automatically determine AV
navigation/driving rule localization enforcement especially near an
international border.

Volkswagen has updated its Car-Net mobile app with deeper Siri integration
to allow drivers to perform specific tasks remotely from their vehicle,
enabling users to lock or unlock their car from far away just by asking
Apple's digital assistant on an iPhone.

Announced on Monday, iPhones and iPads running iOS 12 can start to use Siri
with the Car-Net &lt;<a href="http://www.vw.com/carnet">http://www.vw.com/carnet</a>&gt; app to control their vehicle.
Once set up with the app, Siri can be used to change whether or not the car
is locked, and to check the estimated mileage remaining for fuel, or for
electric vehicles, how much charge is remaining.

If the driver has forgotten where the car is located in a parking lot, they
can also ask Sir to flash or honk the car's horn so it can be more easily
found.

There are also several shortcuts that can be enabled in Siri with
personalized phrases, including commands to start or stop charging, to
defrost the windows, to set the climate control temperature, and a "where is
my car?" query.

BBC, 12 Nov 2018
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-27662580">https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-27662580</a>

Finnish Prime Minister Juha Sipila has said the GPS signal in his country's
northern airspace was disrupted during recent NATO war games in Scandinavia.
He said he believed the signal had been jammed deliberately and that it was
possible Russia was to blame because it had the means to do so.  Finland is
not a NATO member but joined the war games which began last month.  Norway
also reported GPS problems during the exercises near Russia's north-western
borders.

“It is difficult to say what the reasons could be but there are reasons to
believe it could be related to military exercise activities outside Norway's
borders,'' Wenche Olsen, director of the Civil Aviation Authority of Norway,
told the *Barents Observer* earlier this month.

Russia is also suspected of jamming the GPS signal in Norway's border area
last year when it held its own war games.  Relations between NATO and Russia
have been strained since Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.  How
serious was the disruption?  The Finnish region of Lapland and northern
parts of Norway close to the Russian border were affected, with the
Norwegian regional airline Widerøe confirming its pilots had
experienced GPS disruption, Germany's DW news site reports.

However, the airline pointed out that pilots aboard civilian aircraft had
other options when a GPS signal failed.

“This is not a joke, it threatened the air security of ordinary people,''
said Mr Sipila, who is himself an experienced pilot.  “It is possible that
Russia has been the disrupting party in this. Russia is known to possess
such capabilities.''

How could Russia block the signal?

GPS is a global navigation system originally devised by the US military
which works by sending signals from satellites above the Earth back down to
receivers.  "Technology-wise, it's relatively easy to disturb a radio
signal, and it's possible that Russia was behind it," Mr Sipila was quoted
as saying.  Russia's electronic warfare capability has impressed many NATO
commanders, the BBC's Jonathan Marcus wrote last year.

The country has its own, lesser-known global navigation system, called Glonass.

Why were the wargames held?

NATO'S biggest military exercise since the Cold War, code-named Trident
Juncture, rehearsed how the US-led alliance would respond to the invasion of
an ally.  All 29 NATO members, as well as Finland and Sweden, were involved
and it took place a few hundred miles from Norway's border with Russia.  At
one point in the exercises, a Russian maritime reconnaissance plane flew
past a US warship, the USS Mount Whitney.

The exercises began on 25 October and ended last Wednesday.

Just after they ended, an oil tanker collided with one of the Norwegian
warships involved, in a fjord in southern Norway. The warship had been
repeatedly warned of its collision course with the tanker, the BBC was told.

Informative series on disinformation campaigns (aka Active Measures
== Bullsh*t), their discovery, patterns/characteristics, and mechanisms to
counter them. Note: the United States has conducted, and likely continues to
conduct, disinformation campaigns internationally to achieve certain
strategic and/or tactical political/policy objectives.

Interesting to note that a disinformation campaign, as conducted by Russia's
GRU, follows 7 rules for deployment:

Rule 1) "Find a Crack"
Rule 2) "The Big Lie"
Rule 3) "A Kernel of Truth"
Rule 4) "Conceal your Hand"
Rule 5) "The Useful Idiot"
Rule 6) "Deny Everything"
Rule 7) "The Long Game"

Risks by the bushel: (a) uninformed electorate that believes disinformation
despite factual evidence to the contrary; (b) political governance that
applies similar disinformation tactics to mislead and polarize populace or
is not versed in policy formulations to counteract it; (c) dissolution of
democracy; (d) severing of strategic international relationships; (e) social
media business profit preservation and prioritization (exploiting viral and
divisive content) to subvert democratic process.

Still a few months away, but perhaps worth knowing ahead of time: on
Saturday, 6 April, 2019, 23:25 UTC, the GPS week counter field will roll
over:

&gt; However, the [GPS data] field that contains the week number is a 10-bit
&gt; binary number. This limits the range of the week number to 0 “ 1023,
&gt; or 1024 total weeks.
&gt;
&gt; GPS week zero started January 6, 1980. The 1024 weeks counter ran out and
&gt; rolled over on August 21, 1999. The week counter then reset to zero, and
&gt; it has been recounting ever since. The next time the counter will reach
&gt; week 1023 and rollover to zero is on April 6, 2019.
&gt;
&gt; Receivers must properly interpret that week number as the correct date,
&gt; not 19.7 years into the past or future. To do this, receivers use various
&gt; methods to ensure that they are providing the correct date. One common
&gt; method is to use the firmware date as a reference. This works well if the
&gt; receiver is new or is receiving firmware updates. It is also possible
&gt; for the user to modify this reference date in some receivers.

I was reminded of this by a recent article:

&gt; When a Pennsylvania county's 911 system suddenly went down without
&gt; warning, garbled messages across the network impacted fire and police
&gt; agencies' ability to respond to emergency messages. The issue was traced
&gt; to a firmware malfunction on communications equipment, related to
&gt; provision of GPS timing. The firmware had not been updated
&gt; for 19-1/2 years. Why should it have been?  Everything was working fine
&gt;—until it didn't.

Spectre is no longer just an annoyance; it is a scandal bigger than
Dieselgate, affecting *billions* of people.

Is it just me, or does anyone else in computer science feel a deep sense of
embarrassment and betrayal ?

We professionals in computer science have spent 50+ years advocating proper
code hygiene in which every array reference is properly bounds-checked to
avoid the dreaded *buffer overflow*, which is the source of perhaps the
largest fraction of software bugs and hacking vulnerabilities.

We've beaten up on computer languages such as C &amp; C++ for their bad hygiene,
and attempted to steer students towards modern languages which are *safe by
design*, because they obsessively and anally check every array reference.

What has our caution, advice and conscientious programming netted us?

We've been undone by our hardware vendors, whose CPU's *ignore* our
*explicit instructions* (what is it about the words "instruction",
"command", "order code" do these vendors not understand?) to check every
array reference—e.g., hence the Spectre bugs.

Isn't it time for a *class action lawsuit* against every CPU vendor whose
*defective* and *dangerous* products exhibit Spectre vulnerabilities ?

This is not just *negligence*, but outright *fraud*, because these CPU's
violate their own specifications and advertising—their own instruction
reference manuals !

It is as if an automobile manufacturer put a Spectre-like bug in our
automobile braking systems which occasionally ignored the brake pedal
because it adversely affected gas mileage.  Who cares about a few
"accidental" deaths here and there, if the manufacturer can claim a few
percentage points additional gas mileage?

***What the CPU manufacturers have done is every bit as bad as what the auto
   manufacturers did to *cheat government emissions testing*! ***

In a post-Supermicro-scoop world, it's important for security
teams to review the basics on detecting and guarding against hardware
backdoors.

Malicious software is relatively easy to find, but what if your actual
device is the enemy?

Last month, Bloomberg Businessweek broke a story on Chinese nation-state
actors secretly implanting spy chips in targeted motherboards manufactured
by mega-supplier Supermicro, compromising large enterprises in both the
public sector and the private sector. This story came on the heels of
multiple revelations earlier this year by security researchers backed by the
Department of Homeland Security that the firmware of millions of
Chinese-manufactured smartphones was compromised.

There is much skepticism over the Bloomberg story because of vehement
denials by the organizations implicated and other factors. If nothing else,
though, it serves as a good wake-up call to IT security for guarding against
hardware-embedded backdoors. For years, after all, it has been anticipated
that China would try--or has already tried--embedding
malicious backdoors directly into hardware. In 2012, researchers discovered
a serious embedded backdoor in a Chinese-manufactured FPGA chipset used by
military and aerospace organizations in the West. In this instance, for what
it's worth, the cybersecurati generally agreed that this backdoor
was inadvertent, not malicious. However, even inadvertent backdoors can be
converted to malicious ones if discovered by the wrong person.

A number of iPhone users have discovered their Apple ID has been locked on
all of their Apple devices, preventing them from accessing stored data and
related services, with the lockdowns occurring for seemingly unknown
reasons. ...

It is unclear exactly what is happening to cause the accounts to be locked,
but the significant rise in online complaints suggests it has happened to a
large number of people at the same time with the first "wave" at about
midnight eastern time. While it could be caused in error by Apple's account
security protocols, there is also the chance that the accounts are being
probed by a malicious actor, though ultimately the reason behind the locking
of accounts is unknown in this case.

Sources inside Apple not authorized to speak for the company advised to
/AppleInsider/ "At present, this doesn't appear to be an Apple bug.
Whatever it is, it is only impacting a minute percentage of our users."

company's products and finding and reporting any vulnerabilities to the
people who can fix them. Ideally, they help companies root out flaws in
their code and hardware, making the world safer for businesses and

No. 11, Pages 157-165.
"LIBS: A Bioelectrical Sensing System from Human Ears for Staging
  Whole-Night Sleep Study"

Sleep study.  Good thing, right.
Replace the electrode cap applied by a technician with some foam earplugs,
saves money, do it at home, results almost as good,
plus you can get not only EEG but eye tracking and muscle contractions.
They sound very proud.

Then their paper ends with a section on other stuff they could do with this.
- autism onset detection
- meditation training
- eating habit monitoring
Well hmm.
- autonomous audio steering... train a hearing aid to favor amplifying
  sounds from where the user is looking
- also combine with the EEG signal and micro expression to see how pleased
  the wearers are with the sound they hear
- distraction and drowsiness detection .. see if drivers are alert
- child's interest assessment .. see what the student is paying attention to
  in class

OK, but then this could be used to
-- see if Winston Smith is paying attention to the telescreen
-- determine if Winston Smith is pleased by what he hears from Big Brother
-- weed out malcontent and rebellious students
-- detect physiological responses to stimuli ("lie detectors")

oh, not to worry, just don't let anybody stick earplugs with wires on them
in your ears.  and make sure nobody invents a remote-sensing EEG, and beware
of high quality sensor cameras that might pick up your micro expressions and
other body responses

yup, nobody would ever use this for evil, right.

if Alexa or Siri offers us a useful gadget that promises to make us happy,
will we be allowed to decline?

I bet Joe Weizenbaum would be cautious.

"Scientists used ultrasound scanners to look at blood vessels in the necks

"They found those with the most intense pulses went on to experience greater
cognitive decline over the next decade than the other study participants.

"An international team of experts, led by University College London (UCL),

"A more intense pulse can cause damage to the small vessels of the brain,

Catch-22. More powerful ultrasonic pulses required to spot cognitive decline

* Use of AIDA is aligned with the firm's ethical standards, values and

* AIDA - driven decisions are held to at least the same ethical
   standards as human-driven decisions.

Mapping explainable AI characteristics to these principles is a challenge.

  A controversial health app developed by artificial intelligence firm
  DeepMind will be taken over by Google, it has been revealed.  Streams was
  first used to send alerts in a London hospital but hit headlines for
  gathering data on 1.6 million patients without informing them.  DeepMind
  now wants the app to become an AI assistant for nurses and doctors around
  the world.  One expert described the move as "trust demolition".

IGNORE THE RANTS! - Google taking over this app does ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to
reduce the privacy protections included therein, nor does it mean that the
related health data will be combined with any other Google data. A textbook
example of wacky knee-jerk reactions!

Scientists warn that hackers could weaponize artificial intelligence (AI) to
conceal and accelerate cyberattacks and potentially escalate their
damage. IBM researchers last month demonstrated "DeepLocker" AI-powered
malware designed to hide its damaging payload until it reaches a specific
victim, identifying its target with indicators like facial- and
voice-recognition and geolocation. IBM's Marc Stoecklin said with
DeepLocker, "AI becomes the decision maker to determine when to unlock the
malicious behavior." Meanwhile, the Stevens Institute of Technology's
Giuseppe Ateniese has investigated the use of generative adversarial
networks (GANs), which contain two neural networks that collaborate to
deceive safeguards like passwords; he designed a GAN that fed leaked
passwords found online into an AI model, to analyze patterns and narrow down
likely passwords faster than brute-force attacks. Said Ateniese, "We need to
study how AI can be used in attacks, or we won't be ready for them."

Google found a serious privacy bug in its Google+ service, but it did

time, it announced that it would be winding down the Google+ service,
it would impose new privacy limits on developer's for Android apps,
and it would limit the sharing of information about Gmail users.
Google said it could not notify users about the bug when it was first
discovered because it was not sure which users were affected.

  Spending too much time on "social media" sites like Facebook is making
  people more than just miserable. It may also be making them depressed.

  A new study conducted by psychologists at the University of Pennsylvania
  has shown—for the first time—a causal link
  between time spent on social media and depression and loneliness, the
  researchers said.

  It concluded that those who drastically cut back their use of sites like
  Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat often saw a marked improvement in their
  mood and in how they felt about their lives.

  "It was striking," says Melissa Hunt, psychology professor at University
  of Pennsylvania, who led the study. "What we found over the course of
  three weeks was that rates of depression and loneliness went down
  significantly for people who limited their (social media) use."

  Many of those who began the study with moderate clinical depression
  finished just a few weeks later with very mild symptoms, she says.

  The study, "No More FOMO: Limiting Social Media Decreases Loneliness and
  Depression," was conducted by Melissa Hunt, Rachel Marx, Courtney Lipson
  and Jordyn Young, is being published by the peer-reviewed Journal of
  Social and Clinical Psychology.

The Zebra, the nation's leading car insurance search engine, today released
findings of an investigative report that explores whether the U.S. auto
insurance industry—which serves 250 million U.S. drivers—is collecting
and using data about consumers' online behaviors and preferences (their
"digital footprints") to calculate what people pay for their car insurance
policies.

their sexual orientation, interests, profession, thorough physical

[This story]  is like something out of an urban legend.

At nearly 2 a.m. on 18 November, a 29-year-old woman was playing video games
in her apartment in the Mitsumatsu area of Kaizuka City, Osaka Prefecture.
She was playing with a pair of headphones on so as not to disturb the
neighbors in her building. However, in the middle of her game all the power
in her apartment suddenly went out.

She walked toward the front door where the fuse box was, but instead found
the silhouette of a strange man standing inside her apartment, having
somehow gained entrance to her home. He had apparently pulled the circuit
breaker moments earlier, and his entrance had been drowned out by the sounds
of her gaming.

Fuse boxes are often found next to the front door of Japanese apartments.

I would just like to point out that, just because a card is EMV enabled, it
does not mean it cannot be attacked by other means such as compromising the
POS device. I have recently returned to the UK from a trip that took me to
Texas, New Mexico and California. While I was pleased to see a lot of
merchants are now using chip and PIN in the US there were a disappointingly
high number of places where the mag stripe on my EMV card was `swiped'
through the reader and I still had to sign for my purchase.  I know that
will not account for anything like all of the 90% quoted in the article but
it would be worth analysing if there is still a disproportionately high risk
from merchants who have yet to migrate to chip and PIN.

The problem is that enough data to commit fraud is still held in the mag
stripe on the card. Until such time as the mag stripe can be eliminated the
cards will be vulnerable. I haven't yet been brave enough to run a strong
magnet over the stripe on one of my cards to see what the effect might be.

&gt; Has Rob Slade not heard of "The exception proves the rule"? Yes I know

That turns out not to be the case. It's a very old legal maxim which says
that an exception in the law presupposes the rule it's an exception to. So a
sign saying that parking is allowed on Tuesdays implies that there's a rule
that it's not allowed on the other days. There are several sites which trace
the etymology; one of the more trusted might be
&lt;<a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/exceptional-proof/">https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/exceptional-proof/</a>

&gt; It is also an inconvenient fact that people dismiss inconvenient facts as
&gt; "oh that's just an anecdote". But it only takes one inconvenient anecdote
&gt; to be verifiable, at which point it becomes a data point capable of
&gt; destroying your theory and lifetime's work.

As we just saw, what's "obvious" or "almost certain" may not be
true. Anecdotes tend to be passed along and morphed by the
whisper-down-the-lane effect.

The other problem with anecdotes is confirmation bias.  There are, say, ten
horrible crashes of self-driving cars.  But how many would have been avoided
by an alert driver?  How many miles of self-driving have there been total,
and how does that compare to human-driven miles vs. crashes?

&gt; If there are a lot of anecdotes out there you cannot just dismiss and
&gt; ignore them.

"My cousin's friend was abducted by aliens. What you gotta say about that,
Mr. Scientist?" While there are anecdotes which shouldn't be ignored, there
are some which which should be. There are enough reputable people on all
sides of the self-driving car controversies that I expect the truth to come
out, and probably in a timely fashion.

Which is illegal - staying in the outside lane, that is. Certainly in
the UK. And I got fined in the old GDR for doing that.

In the UK, every lane except the nearside is designated a passing (or
overtaking) lane and is supposed to be used *only* for that purpose. If
there's a lot of traffic, people stay in the outer lanes because they're
continually overtaking other vehicles.

Or they stay in the outer lanes when they shouldn't, which is actually a
major problem. Hogging the middle lane on a motorway is seen as a minor
infringement, but on a motorway many vehicles are not allowed to use the
outside lane. So if I'm doing 60 towing a caravan, and come across a
lane-hog doing 50, I can't get past! If I undertake that's called dangerous
driving, and if I overtake then I'm in big trouble for using a lane I am
explicitly barred from.

Terrible article by Fortune. EMV was never expected to "put an end to
rampant credit card fraud". EMV was expected to make it harder to do CP
(Card-Present) fraud, which it has done. And to nobody's surprise (in the
Payments industry, anyway) CNP (Card-Not-Present) fraud has gone up while CP
fraud has gone down, just as it has in every other market when EMV was
introduced.

As has surely been discussed here before, the U.S. issuers chose chip &amp;
signature instead of chip &amp; PIN as is used in other markets. The stated
reason for this is that PINs are "inconvenient", and are thus seen as a
competitive disadvantage: if my Chase Visa requires a PIN and my Citi Visa
doesn't, the theory is that I'm more likely to use the Citi card.

This logic seems thin at best. I believe a more likely real reason is that
chip&amp;signature was easier for issuers to implement in their mostly
home-grown back-end systems. And this seems to be supported by the fact that
most U.S. issuers don't even support chip&amp;PIN. If not for the implementation
cost, one would assume that issuers would have added chip&amp;PIN *support* at
least while adding EMV support, and thus would at least allow PINs.

A few domestic issuers do support chip&amp;PIN: if you ask, they will issue a
PIN. But that doesn't mean using the card will ask for a PIN in most
cases. It does, however, prepare you for international travel, where
chip&amp;PIN is pretty well universal and you may be SOL if you don't have a
PIN.

'"To just give you a sense of how well the technology is working and rapidly
improving...in the last year we've had 3,500 reports," she says.  That means
AI monitoring is causing Facebook to contact emergency responders an average
of about 10 times a day to check on someone—and that doesn't include
Europe, where the system hasn't been deployed.  (That number also doesn't
include wellness checks that originate from people who report suspected
suicidal behavior online.)

"Davis says the AI works by monitoring not just what a person writes online,
but also how his or her friends respond. For instance, if someone starts
streaming a live video, the AI might pick up on the tone of people's
replies.

'"Maybe like, 'Please don't do this,' 'We really care about you.' There are
different types of signals like that that will give us a strong sense that
someone may be posting of self-harm content," Davis says.'

The National Institute for Mental Health (NIHM) sites these statistics for
2016 (<a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/suicide.shtml">https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/suicide.shtml</a>):

* Suicide was the tenth leading cause of death overall in the United States,
claiming the lives of nearly 45,000 people.  * Suicide was the second
leading cause of death among individuals between the ages of 10 and 34, and
the fourth leading cause of death among individuals between the ages of 35
and 54.

* There were more than twice as many suicides (44,965) in the United States
as there were homicides (19,362).

The age-adjusted suicide rate (per 100,000 persons) in 2016 was 21.3 for
men, 6.0 for women, with a 13.4 suicides/day national average (see Table 1
from the shtml page above).

One year post-deployment of Facebook's AI algorithm to spot customer suicide
potential w/o a statement of false positive detection or false negative
detection is curious.

The reference in Solomon's post
(<a href="https://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/28/45%23subj3">https://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/28/45%23subj3</a> 70% detection accuracy was
achievable by analyzing Twitter posts from 171 users. Equivalent arithmetic
for Facebook suggests (1-0.7)*3500 = 1050 emergency calls are false
positives.

The NIMH age-adjusted statistics of 13.4 daily case average suggests that
not all potential suicides are either engaged or tracked via Facebook,
despite the estimated ~203M users in 2017 (see
<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/408971/number-of-us-facebook-users/">https://www.statista.com/statistics/408971/number-of-us-facebook-users/</a>

Risk: Emergency service response dilution from suicide detection algorithm
contextual analysis bias.

A new book from Professor Josephine Wolff at Rochester Inst. of Technology
called *You'll see this message when it is too late* is worth reading
&lt;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Youll-this-message-when-late/dp/0262038854/davidstromswebin">https://www.amazon.com/Youll-this-message-when-late/dp/0262038854/davidstromswebin</a>&gt;
there are plenty of other infosec books on the market, to my knowledge this
is first systematic analysis of different data breaches over the past
decade.

She reviews a total of nine major data breaches of the recent past and
classifies them into three different categories, based on the hackers'
motivations; those that happened for financial gain (TJ Maxx and the South
Carolina Department of Revenue and various ransomware attacks); for
cyberespionage (DigiNotar and US OPM) and online humiliation (Sony and
Ashley Madison). She takes us behind the scenes of how the breaches were
discovered, what mistakes were made and what could have been done to
mitigate the situation.

A lot has been already written on these breaches, but what sets Wolff's book
apart is that she isn't trying to assign blame but *dive into their root
causes and link together various IT and corporate policy failures that led
to the actual breach*.
