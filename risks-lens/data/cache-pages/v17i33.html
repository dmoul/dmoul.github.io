<p>Electronic Engineering Times, 14 Aug 95, has an article entitled "Neural VOR predicts illness." According to the article, "A complete model of the vestibular-ocular reflex (VOR) was demonstrated here at the World Congress on Neural Networks. The
neural-network-based model accurate mimics not only the behavior of a VOR but the abnormal behavior of damaged VORs. Separately, the author estimates that at least two months' exposure to inaccurate virtual-reality simulations could damage health
VORs."</p>
<p>Choose your interpretation... does this highlight a RISK of virtual reality, or a RISK of drawing real-world conclusions from computer modelling?</p>

<p>An article in the _Boston Globe_ 8 Sept 1995 mentioned that some Sony miniature satellite dishes have a problem, the nature of which is that the screen freezes and the audio drops for a second or two. What raised my eyebrows was a comment by a Sony
official that the company is investigating the possibility of downloading a fix into the dishes (the problem is apparently software in nature, with the result being that the tuner doesn't lock properly). This would require no action on the part of users,
and the TV set (in the words of the article) would not need to be on when the fix was downloaded for it to have effect.</p>
<p>If the official knew that this kind of remote reprogramming facility exists (as opposed to this person being a PR flack just blowing smoke), well, the possibilities may be left to the imaginations of my fellow RISKS readers.</p>

<p>The following extract is from an advertisement for a program called WDPass:</p>
<p>Never lose your passwords again. For many organisations the major deterrent to using the security features in programs such as WordPerfect and Lotus 1-2-3 is the fear of rendering crucial files inaccessible by losing or forgetting passwords. It is
logical to have an immediate solution to recovering passwords and enhancing security.</p>
<p>WDPass can immediately recover lost passwords and, thus access locked files allowing users to feel secure in using passwords to lock confidential files.</p>
<p>[Ingram Micro Services advertisement in September 1995 issue of Connectivity (a newsletter published by the PC User Group)]</p>
<p>The program claims to work for a variety of Wordperfect, Microsoft, Lotus and Borland file formats. I find it hard to believe that anyone could read this advert and think that buying a program that breaks the passwords on all of their files will make
the confidentiality of their data more secure, but the risk is that out there are some senior executives gullible enough to think that this allows them to rely entirely on password protection of documents instead of more traditional locks and keys.</p>

<p>A strange virus is invading documents created with Microsoft's popular Word program. While it doesn't destroy files or cause serious damage, it changes files into templates, which can then be awkward to work with or transfer. Microsoft is distributing
a fix that gets rid of the virus and inoculates against future contamination, available though help lines or at &lt; <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">http://www.microsoft.com</a> &gt;. (Wall Street Journal 30 Aug 95 B2) Meanwhile, some would-be Windows
95 users are complaining that they get stuck after the first disk. A Microsoft spokeswoman says that a virus already on the users' computers is at fault — when it's activated by the first Windows 95 disk, it prevents any other disks from being installed.
Details on how to fix the problem will be forthcoming, but meanwhile, users who install the program via floppy disk should use a virus checker to scan their systems first and set the write-protect tab on their program disks before installing them.

<p>In regard to the recent postings on the Word.Macro/WinWord.Concept virus by Paul Ducklin, Gene Spafford and others, there are some related developments of note.</p>
<p>As the postings have said, the concept of macro or interpreted viral "programs" has been known, experimented with and theorized for some time. A major factor in the success of such a virus is a "critical mass" of compatible systems. For a time the Rexx
language appeared to be poised on the brink of "success" as a cross platform macro environment, and currently there is interest in MIME (Multi-purpose Internet Mail Extensions). Neither of those systems, however, has yet become a major player.</p>
<p>By a quirk of chance I have recently reviewed a number of books on Microsoft's Visual Basic. All of them have mentioned Microsoft's move towards Visual Basic for Applications, or VBA. This is to be a fully compatible programming/scripting/macro
environment replacing and augmenting the various macro functions in Microsoft products. Once VBA is implemented, a macro virus word not merely be able to spread from WinWord to MacWord documents, but to Excel, Access, FoxPro and a host of other
applications as well. Indeed, from the information in the books, Microsoft is interested in licensing VBA to other developers for inclusion in non-MS applications.</p>
<p>Perhaps it's time to turn off the macro "autoload" capabilities in all your applications?</p>

<i>Wed, 30 Aug 95 11:57:49 EDT</i>
<p>My colleague, Chuck Weinstock, recently reported to this forum a terrible accident that happened here in Pittsburgh, PA, regarding a head-on collision between two vehicles travelling in opposite directions on a high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane.
Several people were killed in this accident, and two individuals remain hospitalized. This HOV lane is supposedly only open in one direction at a time.</p>
<p>There are three new developments in this incident, according to last night's news:</p>
<ol>
<li>There have been news reports of at least three other incidents of cars travelling in both directions simultaneously in the HOV lane--three more potential head-on crashes occurring just since the fatal accident last week.</li>
<li>An employee of the state department of transportation (PennDoT) who had been responsible for manually opening and closing the gates and turning on/off the signs to control access to the HOV lane was fired yesterday. His attorney reportedly admitted
that he had opened the south end of the lane before closing the north end (in violation of procedure) and then lied to investigators by claiming that he had followed procedures. There may be criminal charges filed against the former PennDoT employee.</li>
<li>PennDoT reportedly is planning to spend a million dollars to upgrade the control system and signage for this HOV lane. According to the news reports, it sounds like they are planning to put into a central location a set of manually-operated switches
to control the gates and signs, much as they are manually controlled in the field by a single operator now.</li>
</ol>
IMHO, I'd have serious concerns about this sort of "automated" control system coupled with the use of a manual checklist. The same potential problem for human error or failure to follow the checklist could still exist, if the appropriate safety mechanisms
are not built in. The only difference is that the problem has now merely moved from the physical gate and sign devices to a control panel in a central facility. All one needs to do is look at the prior literature on human error in control rooms to
validate this concern.
<p>For example, in the nuclear power industry, estimates of human error (as a percentage of system failures) range from twenty to sixty-five percent [Moray88]. Within a particular type of system, operating power plants, 15 to 30% of reported events
occurring during operation involved a human error component [Griffon-Fouco87]. Of these events:</p>
<ul>
<li>approximately 80% occur during operation and periodic tests</li>
<li>about 50% occur in the control room</li>
<li>almost 40% of these errors are evidenced by inappropriate user actions [Griffon-Fouco87].</li>
</ul>
Related studies [Meclot &amp; Griffon-Fouco88] have indicated a number of deep causes of these human failures. Although sixty-two percent of the significant incidents can be attributed to the ergonomics of the workplace and the organization of the work,
another fifty-six percent can be attributed to failure to follow procedures (26%), content of procedures (16%), task complexity (11%) and the form of the procedures (3%).
<p>Taken from these prior studies, procedure following in a control room is still far from perfect reliability--human error can still occur. I hope that PennDoT does more than just add in switches to manually control the HOV lane, and also incorporates
appropriate interlocks into their control room.</p>

%T "Computers, Ethics &amp; Social Values"</p>
<p>Johnson's earlier book, "Computer Ethics" (cf. BKCMPETH.RVW), may be considered the preeminent work in the field. This collection of papers, co-edited with Nissenbaum, enhances, but does not extend, that prior work.</p>
<p>Ethical problems may be divided into a number of groups in the computer world. Three stand out in particular. Some dilemmas arise from a conflict of agreed "good" values. These are the situations described in moral scenarios: should the poor man steal
the medicine necessary to cure his wife from the inventor who will not reduce his price. A second class have to do with unknown or unpredictable situations. In the non-computer world, an example would be megaprojects of unknown environmental impact. The
third grouping would include situations where a vast majority hold to a certain standard of behaviour, while a minority act otherwise. Cults and certain brands of terrorism would fall into this category.</p>
<p>Most non-computer ethical discussion is directed at the first class of problems, and most works on morality in computing follow suit. The articles in this book go a bit further. Chapter five, and parts of six and seven, raise issues related to group
two problems. The ethical analysis is, however, limited and tentative. The inclusion of articles by Stallman, and Dorothy Denning's interview with Frank Drake, would seem to be an attempt to discuss the third type of issues. The bulk of the work, though,
speaks with a single voice from the position of conventional morality, yet fails to address realistically the problem of bringing outsiders into the fold.</p>
<p>The papers seem to have a fair distribution between academic and popular works. Be forewarned: some of the latter have a Saturday-magazine level of accuracy to the information. Non-American readers should note a heavy reliance on American case and
constitutional law, although most discussions are sufficiently detailed as to raise common law issues.</p>

<p>Book: Software Assessment: Reliability, Safety, Testability<br>
Authors: Michael A. Friedman &amp; Jeffrey M. Voas<br>
Publisher: John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York (1-800-225-5945)<br>
ISBN 0-471-01009-X; Hardbound, $54.95</p>
<p>Is software quality testing really effective or just a waste of time? The skeptics conclude that it is an exercise in futility to try to measure the reliability and safety of these complex systems under all critical circumstances. They contend that
quality assurance comes only through a strict adherence to rigorous development process models. In this groundbreaking book, Michael Friedman and Jeffrey Voas dispel that myth. They demonstrate that extremely accurate, cost-effective software quality
testing can now be a reality, thanks to powerful new analytical tools. Central to the approach outlined in Software Assessment is an assessment optimization technique called testability analysis. Pioneered at the College of William and Mary and NASA by
Jeffrey Voas, testability analysis predicts the likelihood that latent bugs will be detected through testing. Because no test oracle is required, testability analysis can be automated. The book offers a balanced presentation of theory and practice.
Featuring exhaustive coverage of the foundations of reliability, safety, and testability, it uses real-world examples, illustrations, and clear descriptions to explore all of the latest techniques for assessing those qualities.</p>
