New York Times Reports Shuttle Software Patch

Excerpted from the New York Times 5-5-89 edition by Henry E. Hardy

[...] In checking the Magellan's control systems two weeks ago, engineers
detected and corrected one potentially catastrophic problem. A design flaw was
found in the software for the spacecraft's computer. If the craft were to lose
its proper orientation to the Sun and the Earth, the flaw could have prevented
the spacecraft from regaining its bearings. The result could have been the loss
of the spacecraft, as it failed to get enough solar energy to run its
electronics and thus could no longer keep its antenna pointed at to Earth.
   Project officials said engineers devised a "patch," a substitute set of 
instructions, to override the design flaw.
   John H. Gerpheide, the Magellan project manager at the Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., said: We're convinced that 
we've got a good fix on the problem. The fix has been tested and 
thoroughly reviewed. We don't have any concern at all."
   Errors in computer instructions were said to have been the cause of 
the failure of Phobos 1, an unmanned Soviet spacecraft, as it was 
headed to Mars last September. The spacecraft tumbled out of 
control. And the craft, unable to keep its solar panels pointed to the 
Sun, ran out of electricity.
   The companion craft, Phobos 2, made it to an orbit of Mars and 
then failed as it was maneuvering to drop scientific instruments on 
the tiny Martian moon Phobos. Soviet scientists who were here to 
view the launching of the Atlantis said the cause of the Phobos 2 loss 
was still unclear.

Here is a NASA press release on a self-diagnostic *IN FLIGHT* maintenance
system.  I am sure this would be useful in tracking down problems but I can
only imagine the problems that could arise from trusting such a system.

    "But the computer said it was fixed"

    -David Robinson

NASA FLIES FIRST AIRCRAFT SELF-DIAGNOSTICS SYSTEM   (  RELEASE:  89-69 )

     In the first flight in a joint NASA/USAF program that promises
self-repairing flight controls and lower maintenance costs in future aircraft,
computers aboard the NASA Ames-Dryden F-15 Flight Research Aircraft were able
to correctly identify and isolate in flight a simulated failure in the flight
control system.

     Flight control system failures can and do occur during flight.  When this
happens, costly ground maintenance diagostic tests are conducted to try to
identify the failure so that appropriate corrective actions may be taken.  In
many cases, the failure cannot be identified during ground tests because the
actual flight conditions are not duplicated.  With the new expert system
technology, failures can be identified and isolated before landing and be fixed
immediately.

     The first simulated failure was an angle-of-attack sensor.  The
maintenance diagnostic system correctly identified the failure and isolated the
problem.  Future tests will incorporate other failures.

     "This is a real breakthrough in flight control system maintenance
diagnosis for future aircraft," says F-15 Flight Research Aircraft Project
Manager Dr. James Stewart.  "Newer digitally-controlled aircraft are more
complex.  However, digital controls allow this type of computer programming
which will reduce the maintenance cost of future digitally-controlled
aircraft."

     The maintenance diagnostic system is the first technology to be tested in
the Self-Repairing Flight Control Program.  The other technologies, scheduled
to begin flight tests this fall, include failure detection, identification and
reconfiguration of the flight control system.

     An example of the need for reconfiguration is when a tail surface fails in
flight.  The flight control system will be reconfigured (repair itself) so that
other surfaces take over the function of the failed tail surface.  Also, a
pilot alert system will tell the pilot what the problem is and what the new
configuration and flight envelope are after the system has self repaired.

     This program is being conducted by NASA's Ames-Dryden Flight Research
Facility, Edwards, Calif., and is sponsored by the Air Force Wright Research
and Development Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.  The prime
contractor, McDonnell Aircraft Company, St. Louis, Mo., with the General
Electric Aircraft Control System Division, Binghampton, N.Y., designed and
developed the maintenance diagnostic system for use in the NASA program.

I found the fuss about Northrop's statement that the first B-2 will be a
production aircraft to be unjustified.  The mere fact that they say it is not a
prototype does not mean that it is not a prototype, My dictionary defines
"prototype" as a first or early example of something.  Nobody is claiming that
the first will be the second or a late example of the B-2.  Whatever they call
it, the risks will be the same.  Some organisations and spokesmen will use any
excuse to stir up a controversy.

Software engineers please do not be misled.  It is not the generation nor even
the design that requires a prototype.  The prototype is part of the design.
The design is not complete without it.  All assertions to the contrary are
fallacious and dangerous.

Engineering of any kind is risky enough without this kind of foolishness.

<pre>
There is a subtlety here that people not intimate with military aviation may
not appreciate.  This is not as big an innovation as Northrop is claiming.  It
has been common for quite some time to build even the first one of a new
aircraft in "production" tooling.  Although it does save a lot of time, it also
contributes greatly to realistic testing.  Things like production processes
affect the result; it simply is not possible, in practice, for a hand-built
prototype to accurately represent production hardware.  Proper testing requires
hardware built with production tooling.  This practice started with the USAF's
"Cook-Craigie plan" techniques in the 1950s.

(Many of the critics quoted in the Philadelphia Inquirer article are making
fools of themselves because they don't understand this.)

Doing this also helps a lot when one wants to get production moving rapidly
after testing; part of Cook-Craigie is a scheme whereby early stages of
production ramp up fully while later stages concentrate on getting the first
few aircraft out the door, the hope being that any modifications that are
needed will not affect the early stages badly.

Inevitably, this sort of thing involves risk that production tooling will need
to be torn up and revised because testing finds problems, and that half-built
aircraft may need expensive revisions or even scrapping.  Efforts are made to
get the thing right the first time, and to get good test results as quickly as
possible.  Sometimes it works well; sometimes not.  As in other such production
innovations, after early successes there was a tendency for later projects to
get the outline right — first aircraft built in production tooling, first
stages of production rolling early — while forgetting important unorthodox
details like the emphasis on intensive early testing.  The result is failures,
which tend to be blamed on bad luck or the inherent difficulty of the problem
rather than on bad management.

(Another production innovation which suffered the same fate was concurrency:
designing all the pieces of the hardware simultaneously, relying on good
interface documentation to make sure they all work together.  When it works, it
gets hardware out the door much sooner than step-by-step methods.  It worked
well for the early ICBM programs because (a) they consistently funded multiple
parallel development efforts for anything deemed risky, and (b) they didn't
choose between them until hardware was available to be tested.  Many later
programs adopted concurrent development without these important (and expensive)
details, the result being a lot of failures.)

The ultimate end product of remembering the successes but forgetting the
details is what's going on at Northrop:  the conviction that it's possible to
get everything right the first time, so no modifications will be needed and
full-scale production can start immediately.  That *is* folly, but not because
there aren't any prototypes.

Rich Neitzel's anecdotes do not justify his conclusion.  In every case that he
mentioned there were standards that were clear enough and substantive enough
that, in his opinion, they were not met by the products in question.  We have
no such standards in software.  He points out that we will never eliminate
fraud and incompetence.  The fact that there will always be people who cheat
does not mean that we should not have standards.  Au contraire!

  "A bad standard is better than nothing.  It gives you something to violate."
  [A quote from the Hammer Forum, 1986]

  "Standards are like motherhood: They should not come too soon, and there
  should be an identifiable father."  [CAPT John Nichols, USN, 1968]

  Gordon Bell said it best in his seminal essay, "Standards Can Help Us," IEEE
  COMPUTER, June 1984, pp. 71-78.  Serious readers should review that article.

The practical application of the tongue-in-cheek advice from Hammer '86, and
from Nichols and Bell, is that at the least, standards, even flawed ones, give
us the basis for further discussion, based on something more than just personal
taste.  I remember discussing computer system reliability with representatives
of UNIVAC, early in this decade.  These capable folks had arguably one of the
best systems of that era - the UNIVAC 1100 series.  Its ancestors had succeeded
despite a history of frequent crashes, which were then common in the industry.
Newer systems, with designs unhampered by demands for "backwards compatability"
with older models, and free to use newer technology, were beginning to
demonstrate an order of magnitude more reliable performance; e.g., one crash a
quarter instead of one per week.  (Actually, the old systems were worse than
that, and the new ones better.)  I lost that argument, because the others were
convinced that "bigger means less reliable."  An analogy about jumbo jets vs.
smaller plans did not help.  It was only when the competition [viz., IBM]
introduced the 308x series, with its multi-megabyte diagnostic code, and MTBF
in months vice hours, that the argument was over.

I'm not suggesting a "standard for reliability."  I am saying that the
effort to make standards can help us appreciate the diversity of our needs,
and the adoption of standards can raise our level of expectations.

Generally rather similar to the risks involved in using other "standard"
tools like compilers, assemblers, text editors, front-panel switches :-),
operating systems, etc.:  there is always a chance that the tool has not
been fully tested and will do the wrong thing silently, or that it will
not catch user errors that it is supposed to catch.

&gt;Is it reasonable to set some criteria ...

Lengthy use tells you something about the average density of bugs in the code,
but won't necessarily tell you about the one bug that's in precisely the wrong
place.  Thorough validation suites are better, although rarer.

Better yet are validation suites for the *application*, ones which do their
best to stress its components.  (Note, this is not the same as "black box"
validation suites written with no knowledge of said components.)  The fact is,
even well-proven tools can have obscure bugs lurking in them.  Case in point:
the C compiler in V7 Unix, an unambitious compiler written by a very good
programmer and exhaustively shaken down by widespread use, had a bug in its
32-bit-divide routine that was not found until people — specifically, some of
my users — stumbled over it.  The code made some assumptions about the
hardware that were true, at least most of the time, of older pdp11 processors
but not of the new 11/44 we had.  The most interesting part was that my fix for
the problem appears to have also cured some much rarer misbehavior found even
on older processors.  The values returned by that routine may have been wrong,
occasionally, all along.

One simply cannot afford to place implicit trust in *any* of the tools used to
build a sensitive application.  As with "end to end" arguments in networking,
to be sure that the final product is right, one must test it directly and not
rely on trusted tools.

About a month ago, I moved to my office, in my new job.  A sun 3/140
workstation was on my desk.  Being more of a thoeretical person, I barely
touched it.  The first day at work hadn't finished and I had a strong
discomfort in my left eye.  When I went home, I had to take my contact lenses
out immediately.  Next day at work, the discomfort became even stronger.  I
have been wearing contact lenses for seven years now but had never felt
something like that before.  This continued during the whole week.

On Saturday, I was surprised to discover that the discomfort had almost gone.
On Sunday, I was feeling perfect.  This prompted me to think that it had
something to do with my work.  The arrangement on my desk is as follows (view
from the top) :

Not only is it possible to pop off the grey cover and use the diagnostic
modulars that are commonly found on the sides of houses (or the nearest
telephone pole), but it is also possible to access nearly every line in an
area of a city fairly easily.  Simply find one of the grey boxes usually at
the base of a phone line tpole where the cable switches from above ground
to below ground.  These junction boxes will usually have x0,000 thousand
twisted pair lines connected together and hanging over a metal bar.  Simply
pick one, and patch in w/a pair of aligator clips.  This can also be done
inside of the black covers hanging on telephone poles.

If you really want to create some havoc, cut a couple of twisted pairs in
really hard to reach places...

On a related note, a story:

Our neighbor's hired some people to come in and clean their house.  It was done
in a rather odd fashion; you call a friend of the cleaners who then told the
person that someone called for them.  The cleaner would then return the call--
but would never have a number that they could be reached at.  No big deal, they
were using a pay phone.... wrong.  The person had a phone w/ aligator clip
instead of RJ-11 male connnector in a bucket.  Acting like they were pruning
the bushes, they would tap a neighbor's line and call whenever they needed....

It really does happen!

Whenever my local telephone company (Illinois Bell) installs new service
or alters existing service they move the telephone network interface
outside.  They do this to simplify their access for testing.

When I had a second telephone line installed at my home, the installer was
about to replace the existing network interface in the basement with a
gray box outside.  It took me some time to convince the installer to put
the network interface inside.

I have just discovered that our local Electricity Supply Company is 
using PC's and now even X-windowed VMS &amp; Unix systems to bring circuits
up and down: an iconic display allows a mouse-click and a keyboard
confirm to activate a circuit breaker, through comms links to the grid. 

Apparently NO physical token exchange is used between linespeople
and controllers: A verbal confirmation, coupled to somebody watching the 
breaker come in or out is all that is used.

Perhaps I'm being too paranoid, but If I were a linesman I'd want to
see the key for that segment in my hands before I climbed the tower,
much as permanent way crews do (used to?) for track repairs, or train 
drivers for bi-directional single-line working.

Should  automated systems maintain physical key/token exchanges from the 
past? is there an electronic "equivalent" that could be used instead?

On the plus side, They're using Radar scans of lightning strikes and
the PC network to offer some predictive services: they try and direct
line-crews to be on the alert *before* a storm reaches their section.

On the whole I think the use of computers, especially bitmapped displays
is beneficial in this area: they can condense a lot of information into
one screen, in a simple and intuitive form. Of course, providing some
active control has an "inverted" effect: simple mistakes can propagate out
into catastrophies.

Last week, I went to our local bank to do a money transfer to an american bank.
Though the clerk had a terminal on her desk, she fetched a typewriter and had
to type everything on a paper form. This surprised me a bit as the bank says
they are very up to date with technology, but that's something else. I gave her
a piece of paper with all the addresses on the one side (recipient and bank),
and on the other side, there was the bank routing number and the account
number. I thought she had done everything all right, took my copy of the form,
paid the thing and went home. When I came home, the bank had already closed as
it was 18.25. I took the form out and discovered that she had not filled in the
bank routing number. This made me curious and I took out my little paper and
checked the form... BINGO! I found out that she had written the address of the
recipient correctly, but had written the zip code of the bank as the account
number and no bank routing number, except: Household Bank, Columbus, Ohio. Next
morning I ran to the bank and told them about this. They immediately called
their headquaters as all those forms are sent of after the bank closes.
Luckily, they could take the form out of the stack and everything was all
right. The clerk said :"Oh, there was something on the back side, too? I only
read the front side.". She didn't even notice!

But imagine if the computer had done this immediately...  either the computer
would have rejected the input or I could have paid the whole thing twice..
