The Full Tilt Poker website (run offshore from the U.S., of course)
“was not a legitimate poker company but a global Ponzi scheme," according
to P.S Bharara, U.S. attorney.  Entrusted with $390 million of gamblers'
money, FTP managed to transfer these funds to its owners and managers.
The gamblers were “taking on far more risk than they realized, even when
they had no chips on the virtual table.''

RISKS has long warned about trusting untrustworthy third parties, but this
case brings some of the risks of cloud computing home to roost quite
dramatically.

ALL of the "Big Four" accounting firms listed in the attached article do the
same thing: send soi disant "auditors" around who look like they just
graduated high-school but wear expensive suits and &gt;$800 ties/shoes. And who
work from stale checklists. And don't know what the hell they do (and never
will). But they wear expensive clothing.

I have seen the look of amazing ignorance and stupidity on the faces of
these "auditors" so many times that it has gotten burned into my neurons to
such a remarkable degree that if re-incarnation actually happens then while
I might forget my own ego I will certainly never forget that idiotic look. I
can spot it instantly, like an experienced cop can spot a drunken driver
(the same look, actually; cops call it "drunk eyes"—a characteristic
beady far-off unfocused felonious stare that denotes a person totally
non-functional, non-ethical, and out-of-touch).

I could tell a few hundred horror stories about them.

Like a place that only a few days ago (and which you will definitely not
hear about in the news) that found out that, contrary to these very
sartorially expensive auditors, they actually *didn't* do backups even
though everyone thought they did (the software logs said so!), which came as
a rather horrible, shocking, and sickening surprise. The operators didn't
bother changing the tapes (but the software logs showed everything okay!)
and therefore they wound up using the same tapes over-and-over again,
including the ones that should have had the archival data for last year or
so (the surveillance video in the computer room shows the operators zoned
out and staring into space for long periods of time). Of course, the
expensive auditors didn't actually do something as remarkably simple and
basic as checking the written backup log for consistency—wait a tick
. . . WHAT backup log? Oops! (In fairness: the IT director should get the ax
too, but that never happens.)

My favorite first-hand auditor horror story though: the remarkably
high-profile place that had ZERO access control. I do mean ZERO access
control.  You want root access? No problem! Just connect to the system
(remotely works just fine!) and you'd get a nice Unix root shell prompt and
total and unaudited access. Where you could easily and with no risk at all
rob them blind (I don't *think* it happened for some reason that still
eludes me; just lucky, I guess). Did I mention publically available remote
access with no access control of any sort? Not even security-by-obscurity.
These brain dead suits from PriceWaterhouse Coopers didn't notice (did I
*really* name that prestigious Big Four company?).

Someone send an apology consultant to them.

Kevin Gray, Deloitte sued for $7.6 billion, accused of missing fraud (Reuters)
<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/deloitte-sued-7-6-billion-accused-missing-fraud-215604966.html">http://news.yahoo.com/deloitte-sued-7-6-billion-accused-missing-fraud-215604966.html</a>

Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Ltd , the world's largest accounting and consulting
firm, was accused on Monday of failing to detect fraud during its audits of
one of the biggest private mortgage firms to collapse during the
U.S. housing crash.  A trust overseeing the bankruptcy of Taylor, Bean &amp;
Whitaker Mortgage Corp, or TBW, and one of the company's subsidiaries filed
complaints in a Miami Circuit Court claiming a combined $7.6 billion in
losses.  Deloitte "certified TBW as a solvent, viable company with accurate
financial statements every year from 2001 to 2008," one of the complaints
said.  "Despite Deloitte's credentials and expertise as one of the 'Big 4'
accounting firms, those statements—and the rosy picture they depicted of
TBW—were completely false," it said.  Deloitte spokesman Jonathan Gandal
said the "claims are utterly without merit."

It was the latest lawsuit to hit one of the major accounting firms over
their role in the credit crisis.  PriceWaterhouse Coopers, KPMG and Ernst &amp;
Young are also facing accusations about their auditing standards by
investors who collectively seek to recoup billions of dollars lost in the
financial meltdown.

Lee Farkas, the former chairman of Taylor, Bean and Whitaker, was sentenced
to 30 years in prison in April for masterminding what U.S. officials
described as one of the biggest bank frauds ever.  U.S. Justice Department
officials said Farkas ran a $2.9 billion fraud scheme that led to TBW's
downfall and the collapse of one of the largest U.S. regional banks,
Colonial Bank.  The complaint filed by Neil F. Luria, a plan trustee of
Taylor, Bean &amp; Whitaker Trust, claims losses of approximately $6 billion. A
second complaint by Ocala Funding, a wholly owned TBW subsidiary which
served as a lending facility, claims losses of $1.6 billion.
Farkas was accused of running a wide-ranging scheme to cover up large losses
at Taylor, Bean, which was based in Ocala, Florida, by moving funds between
accounts at Colonial Bank and also by selling mortgage loans that either did
not exist, were worthless or had already been sold.

"Deloitte missed this fraud because it simply accepted management's
conflicting, incomplete and often last-minute explanations of
highly-questionable transactions, even though those explanations made no
sense and were flatly contradicted by the documents in Deloitte's
possession," the complaint by Ocala Funding said.  "Ocala relied on Deloitte
to detect material misstatements in the financial statements due to error or
fraud," the complaint said.

Gandal said the plaintiffs in the cases were "companies through which
convicted felon Lee Farkas and his co-conspirators committed their crimes.
The bizarre notion that his engines of theft are entitled to complain of
injury from their own crimes and to sue the outside auditors they lied to
defies common sense, not to mention the law."

Several other Taylor, Bean and Colonial Bank employees who pleaded guilty
for their roles in the fraud were also sentenced earlier this year.

  "So the GPS location of your vehicle and your vehicle's speed are going to
  be collected by OnStar and sold to third parties. What kind of companies
  are interested in this data? OnStar would have you believe that
  respectable agencies, like departments of transportation and various law
  enforcement agencies (for purposes of "public safety or traffic services"
  - A.K.A ticket writing). I can imagine this data COULD be used for good,
  to create traffic based analytics to improve future road construction or
  even emergency response. But given that those types of decisions are only
  made once a decade in most cities, OnStar isn't likely to benefit much
  financially from "respectable" companies."

 - - -

The key aspects of this that are most disturbing are the apparent lack of
any user choice in these regards (except by totally eliminating the service
*and the data connection*!) and the provision of data to law enforcement.
OnStar is really becoming quite problematic in key respects, and may now
have crossed the infamous "creepy" line.

I canceled the OnStar subscription on my new GMC vehicle today after
receiving an e-mail from the company about their new terms and conditions.
While most people, I imagine, would hit the delete button when receiving
something as exciting as new terms and conditions, being the nerd sort, I
decided to have a personal drooling session and read it instead. I'm glad I
did. OnStar's latest T&amp;C has some very unsettling updates to it, which
include the ability to sell your personal GPS location information, speed,
safety belt usage, and other information to third parties, including law
enforcement. To add insult to a slap in the face, the company insists they
will continue collecting and selling this personal information even after
you cancel your service, unless you specifically shut down the data
connection to the vehicle after canceling. ...

Hiawatha Bray: Firms increasingly targets for hackers, Coakley warns,
*The Boston Globe*, 21 Sep 2011

Personal information from nearly one out of three Massachusetts residents,
from names and addresses to medical histories, has been compromised through
data theft or loss since the beginning of 2010, according to statistics
released yesterday by the office of Attorney General Martha Coakley.

A state law enacted in 2007 requires all companies doing business in
Massachusetts to inform consumers and state regulators about security
breaches that might result in identity theft. That could include leaks of
individual names along with other sensitive information, such as Social
Security numbers or bank account, credit card, and debit card numbers. The
law was passed in 2007, after hackers stole 45 million credit card numbers
from Framingham-based retailer TJX Cos.

Coakley said that her office is just beginning to analyze the reports to
find out whether the law is helping to reduce data breaches. But she
predicted the problem will get worse as more Americans store vital personal
data on various computer networks. "There is going to be more room for
employee error, for intentional hacking,'' Coakley said. "This is going to
be an increasing target.''

The attorney general's office has received 1,166 data breach notices since
January 2010, including 480 between January and August of 2011.  About 2.1
million residents were affected by the various incidents, though it's
unknown whether any of them were actually defrauded as a result of the data
leaks. ...

The longer I look at Facebook, the more questions I have about it.

First there is this:
<a href="http://nikcub-static.appspot.com/logging-out-of-facebook-is-not-enough">http://nikcub-static.appspot.com/logging-out-of-facebook-is-not-enough</a>

* Logging out of Facebook is not enough.  (Some members on this list may
  remember a private discussion I had with them about the danger of Facebook
  buttons a while back).

But there appears to be more, although I have not been able to pinpoint yet
what exactly happened.  It appears Facebook can do other things by itself
that you would have expected to require human input.  Anyone ever heard of a
picture being tagged in Facebook without the poster or anyone else doing it?

I have been briefed on an incident where an image of person A was uploaded
by person B (who has person A in a very small circle of friends).

Subsequently, person A gets a notification that an image of them was
uploaded.

 Where it gets interesting:

* Person A's account has otherwise no images associated with it.  Thus, the
  facial biometrics that could be used to ID someone (and ferret out
  duplicate accounts) should not be available.  The reason for the lack of
  images was to avoid publicity—the account is not in a real name.  In
  hindsight, that emerged as a very good move.

* Nobody appears to have tagged the image as containing person A, nor is
  there any Facebook notification which suggests this had happened.

* Person A has another, more public account, WITH images.  This received no
  notification either.

The question is thus how Facebook managed to establish the relationship.
Personally, I'm still betting on someone tagging and then removing the tag
(especially since it happened in a rather small group of individuals and hit
what was in principle the wrong account), but the notification of that
action is missing.

I'm going to run some tests over the next few weeks, but I'd be interested
to hear of any other incidents where data unexpectedly has been linked.
Ideas welcome.

Facebook makes it easier than ever to eavesdrop
The new mini stream feature makes it simple to see what people are
saying, even when they might not realize you're listening
By Ted Samson | InfoWorld

selected text:

What's concerning, though, is the nature of some of the changes that
Facebook has made to counter Google+ in this match-up. At least one feature
is almost certainly going to generate controversy: A new mini feed, combined
with Facebook's new Subscription options, makes it disturbingly easy to
effectively eavesdrop on fellow Facebook friends—that is, to peer in on
exchanges between your Facebook friends, both with mutual pals and people
who are complete strangers to you.  This should be of particular concern for
all the Facebook users who use the site both to interact with real-life
friends on a personal level, as well as family members, coworkers, and
colleagues.

Am I the only one who has spotted increased attempts at mobile phone
number acquisition?

At the moment, personal mobile phone numbers are the last vestige of privacy
-- guess what sites like Facebook and even Hotmail are now asking for under
the pretext of *cough* "extra security" *cough*?  It's not even subtle: the
coercion is extremely aggressive, with frequent messages popping up in the
middle of any usage to more or less harass you into providing more data
(another one is other email addresses you may have).

Now imagine you have given your number, and the price of SMS messages drops.
Unlike any other service, SMS traffic cannot be disabled other than by
killing the phone service itself.  The only barrier between you and spam or
DDoS is cost.  None other.

The US Air Force issued a major revision to its Instruction 51-402
(27Jul2011), changing its title and including "cyber capabilities". The
document "Legal Review of Weapons and Cyber Capabilities" seems to require
looking at risks:

3. Contents of the Legal Review of Weapons and Cyber Capabilities. ...

* 3.1.2.1. Whether the weapon or cyber capability is calculated to cause
  superfluous injury, in violation of Article 23(e) of the Annex to Hague
  Convention IV; and

* 3.1.2.2. Whether the weapon or cyber capability is capable of being
  directed against a specific military objective and, if not, is of a nature
  to cause an effect on military objectives and civilians or civilian
  objects without distinction.

The scope of cyber capabilities is given as:

* Cyber Capability.  For the purposes of this Instruction, an Air Force
cyber capability requiring a legal review prior to employment is any device
or software payload intended to disrupt, deny, degrade, negate, impair or
destroy adversarial computer systems, data, activities or capabilities.
Cyber capabilities do not include a device or software that is solely
intended to provide access to an adversarial computer system for data
exploitation.

* Cyberspace Operations.  A cyberspace operation is the employment of cyber
capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve objectives in or
through cyberspace. Such operations include computer network operations and
activities to operate and defend the Global Information Grid.

As well they should IMHO.

AFAICT, the most "eventful" times during flight tend to occur during take
off and landing, and passengers should be aware of their environment in case
an emergency happens. Similarly the pilots are not playing Angry Birds
during take offs and landings (we hope), but rather concentrating on the
controls of the plane.

I think it's long been shown that consumer electronics don't really
interfere with (most) aviation electronics, and that the real reason is for
situation awareness.

(Personally I don't see what the fuss is about: is it really such a big deal
to "switch off" for twenty or so minutes at the beginning and end of a
flight? But that's just my personality.)

I've been in a Boeing 777 that made a heavy landing in storm conditions (not
a crash, just a heavy landing involving several touchdowns before the plane
finally stayed on the ground); it was sufficiently bad that improperly
closed overhead lockers broke open, and objects (pens, paper notebooks, the
odd netbook computer) hurled free from the lockers damaged bulkheads to the
point where the aircraft would have to be taken out of service for repairs.

Because Boeing considered this risk when the plane was designed, objects
that flew free of the damaged overhead lockers flew down the aisle, and were
therefore unlikely to injure anyone.

The experience leads me to believe that in a crash, some hand-held devices
would be thrown free from their operator with sufficient force to pose a
risk of head injury to an unfortunate passenger in front, with all the
accompanying problems when you try to evacuate the crashed airliner.

The discussion of iPad and other wireless devices on airplanes begs a
question that drives me crazy because it is not often enough asked: If they
require everyone to turn off wireless capabilities to avoid interference
with instruments and communication (I trust there is a safety argument as
well), is this not also a confession that there IS a vulnerability? It seems
to me that it would take little effort to construct a multi-frequency jammer
powerful to cause serious problems. So should not the primary goal be to
harden critical systems against interference and, once achieved, stop
worrying about the consumer electronics?

I suspect the risk of interference is indeed small, with the exception of
the deliberate terrorist ploy I suggest. Blinding a *glass cockpit* aircraft
in a thunderstorm could have dire consequences, especially, as we have seen,
with flight crews' increasing dependence on automation.

&gt; I think it's long been shown that consumer electronics don't really
&gt; interfere with (most) aviation electronics, and that the real reason is
&gt; for situation awareness.

This argument doesn't even begin to hold water.  If situational awareness is
so important, why is my neighbor prohibited from reading the newspaper on
her iPad while it's OK for me to do the same with a physical--and physically
larger--copy of the New York Times?  The same goes for tons of other alleged
distractions, of course, but no passenger is less situationally aware than
the napping one.  I suspect that every flight attendant has a story about
someone who had to be shaken awake after every else on the plane had
departed.

&gt; (Personally I don't see what the fuss is about: is it really such a big
&gt; deal to "switch off" for twenty or so minutes at the beginning and end of
&gt; a flight? But that's just my personality.)

Disregarding the issue of whether it's appropriate to pass judgment on
another person's choice of how to use his time, I'll answer personally: yes,
it can be a huge deal.  It's often the case that those twenty minutes will
come directly out of my already shortened sleep that night.

Keep trying, and keep the best.

  [From a *WSJ* article explaining what your business should do if you find
  indications you've been successfully attacked:]

"Don't unplug. The natural instinct when an employee discovers he or she has
been hacked is to power off the machine (and maybe throw it against the wall
in frustration).

"But it's the wrong move.

"True, turning off the Internet connection and detaching the computer from
the corporate network can help prevent the infection from spreading. But
shutting the machine down can also erase valuable evidence that will help
investigators determine what's been stolen and where it's been sent. A lot
of malware - a catchall term for programs like viruses written and installed
by hackers - resides in a computer's memory and not on the hard drive.
Turning off a computer erases the memory, and with it many traces of the
hack, security experts say."

My opinion: that's a Feb 25, 1993, attitude. Your system is
compromised. Smash the intruder, now. Finding the bad guy would be nice,
   but secondary.

%T   "Above the Clouds: Managing Risk in the World of Cloud Computing"

The preface does a complicated job of defining cloud computing.  The
introduction does provides a simpler description: cloud computing is the
sharing of services, at the time you need them, paying for the services you
need or use.  Different terms are listed based on what services are
provided, and to whom.  We could call cloud computing time-sharing, and the
providers service bureaus.  (Of course, if we did that, a number of people
would think they'd walked into a forty- five year time-warp.)

The text is oddly structured: indeed, it is hard to find any organization in
the material at all.  Chapter one states that the cloud allows you to do
rapid prototyping because you can use patched operating systems.  I would
agree that properly up-to-date operating systems are a good thing, but it
isn't made clear what this has to do with either prototyping or the cloud.
There is a definite (and repeated) assertion that "bigger is better," but
this idea is presented as an article of faith, rather than demonstrated.
There is mention of the difficulty of maintaining core competencies, but no
discussion of how you would determine that a large entity has such
competencies.  Some of the content is contradictory: there are many
statements to the effect that the cloud allows instant access to services,
but at least one warning that you cannot expect cloud services to be
instantly accessible.  Various commercial products and services are noted in
one section, but there is almost no description or detail in regard to
actual services or availability.

Chapter two does admit that there can be some problems with using cloud
services.  Despite this admission some of the material is strange.  We are
told that you can eliminate capacity planning by using the cloud, but are
immediately warned that we need to determine service levels (which is just a
different form of capacity planning).  In terms of preparation and planning,
chapter three does mention a numb of issues to be addressed.  Even so, it
tends to underplay the full range of factors that can determine the success
or failure of a cloud project.  (Much content that has been provided
previously is duplicated here.)  There is a very brief section on risk
management.  The process outline is fine, but the example given is rather
flawed.  (The gap analysis fails to note that the vendor does not actually
answer the question asked.)  SAS70 and similar reports are heavily
emphasized, although the material fails to mention that many of the reasons
that small businesses will be interested in the cloud will be for functions
that are beyond the scope of these standards.  Chapter four appears to be
about risk assessment, but then wanders into discussion of continuity
planning, project management, testing, and a bewildering variety of only
marginally related topics.  There is a very terse review of security
fundamentals, in chapter five, but it is so brief as to be almost useless,
and does not really address issues specifically related to the cloud.  The
(very limited) examination of security in chapter six seems to imply that a
good cloud provider will automatically provide additional security
functions.  In certain areas, such as availability and backup, this may be
true.  However, in areas such as access control and identity management,
this will most probably involve additional charges/costs, and it is not
likely that the service provider will be able to do a better job than you
can, yourself.  A final chapter suggests that you analyze your own company
to find functions that can be placed into the cloud.

Despite the random nature of the book, the breadth of topics means it can be
used as an introduction to the factors which should be considered when
attempting to use cloud computing.  The lack of detail would place a heavy
burden of research and work on those charged with planning or implementing
such activities.  In addition, the heavily promotional tone of the work may
lead some readers to underestimate the magnitude of the task.
