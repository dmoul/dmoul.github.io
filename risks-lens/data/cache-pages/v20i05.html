<pre>
Everyone on Wall Street and elsewhere eagerly awaits the official Bureau of
Labor Statistics statistics, which were due to be posted on their Web site
today.  The BLS takes great pains to avoid leaks.  However, much to
everyone's surprise, some tables appeared YESTERDAY.  As a consequence, BLS
Commissioner Katharine G. Abraham decided to release the full report
yesterday afternoon.  The interpretations were favorable, and the stock
market had a big gain.  Abraham was quoted as saying that even if the early
release ``was a computer error, it was a human failure'' in that the system
was not set up to prevent it.

A prior early release occurred in January 1997, when the Federal Reserve's
Beige Book was released at noon instead of 2 p.m., because no one bothered
to tell the Web site administrators that the time had been delayed.

According to the Drudge Report &lt;<a href="http://www.drudgereport.com">http://www.drudgereport.com</a>&gt;, ABC News
posted ``final election results'' on its web site late Monday night, i.e.,
before the election began.  According to an apology from ABC News (also
quoted by Drudge) â€” and reading between the lines â€” they apparently posted
test data on their live Internet server. ABC News's web site is
&lt;<a href="http://www.abcnews.com">http://www.abcnews.com</a>&gt;.  My very brief look at the ABC News site did not
turn up any explanation or apology on their site.

  [For example, the dummy data showed incumbent Sen. Alfonse D'Amato
  (Rep.) besting Charles E. Schumer (Dem) in the New York Senate race,
  which turned out to be wrong.  PGN]
  [Declan McCullagh &lt;declan@well.com&gt; noted an article by
  Adam Clayton Powell III on the same story, noting that ABC had the
  right outcome on 61 out of 70 Senate and Governor races.  That article
  also noted that Fox TV had accidentally put up an advance dummy page for a
  Yankee-Padre World Series game â€” and almost got it correct!  PGN]

On 4 Nov 1998, the primary and backup radar systems for the Salt Lake Air
Traffic Control Center failed for about a minute, leaving about 200 planes
``up in the air'' over Utah, Nevada, Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming.  Handoffs
were done manually (actually, orally).  [Source: 4 Nov 1998,

We're not sure when the fault (probably a fiber cut, but that's unconfirmed)
actually happened, but Lucent Microelectronics in Allentown, PA lost all
network connectivity at approximately noon today.  AT&amp;T lost approximately
400 T3s, which caused every single Lucent router nationwide to try to
relearn their routes and effectively pegged all routers at 100%.

Because of this, a second outage occurred due to the fact that the routers
were too busy relearning their routes to actually pass traffic.  This was a
nationwide outage for both Lucent and AT&amp;T.  As of 01.45pm, Lucent locations
in Allentown, PA have isolated all traffic from the backbone, so at least
we're back up and running.

<pre>
An internal Microsoft memo written by one of that company's software
engineers indicates that Microsoft is concerned with developing strategies
for competing against free programs that have been gaining popularity with
software developers, such as the operating system Linux.  The memorandum
warns that the usual Microsoft marketing strategy known as FUD (an acronym
for fear, uncertainty, and doubt) won't work against developers of free
software, who are part of the OSS (open-source software) movement that makes
source code readily available to anyone for improvement and testing.  The
memo (<a href="http://www.opensource.org/halloween.html">http://www.opensource.org/halloween.html</a>) says: "The ability of the
OSS process to collect and harness the collective I.Q. of thousands of
individuals across the Internet is simply amazing.  More importantly, OSS
evangelization scales with the size of the Internet much faster than our own
evangelization efforts appear to scale."  (*The New York Times*, 3 Nov 1998;

Approximately 200,000 elderly Brits are not receiving their proper state
pensions because of a computer glitch, losing up to 100 pounds a week for
the past few months.  The problem is blamed on the cutover to a new
170-million-pound computer system, and according to a government source is
likely to take another five months to fix.  [Source: Jon Hibbs, *London

Today's *New England Journal of Medicine* notes a case of a 72-year-old man
whose defibrillator was affected by interference from a Sensormatic
Ultra-Max anti-theft device in a bookstore's shoplifting gate.  Fortunately,
a nurse caught him, recognized the source of the problem, and pulled him
away.  The head of The Heart Institute of St. Petersburg, Florida, noted
that this is the most popular device â€” with 91,000 in use.

Debbie Coller of Sensormatic noted that the FDA advisory panel had found no
significant health hazard.  "Shoplifting gates have been around for about 25
years," she said. "Heart pacemakers have been around even longer.  During
that time, 1 billion safe passages already have occurred."  [Source:
Associated Press item, 4 Nov 1998; PGN Abstracting]

  [But RISKS readers may recall that heart-pacemaker interference deaths
  were reported in 1980 and 1985, and defibrillator interference was
  discussed in <a href="/Risks/19/50">RISKS-19.50</a>.52.53.  This not a new problem.  PGN]

Here is yet another example of a backup system that does not work when
needed.  [Source *Goteborgs-Posten*, via Tidningarnas Telegrambyra News
Service, 29 Oct 1998; Ulf Lindqvist abstracting and translating.]

The central computer for ticket sales and reservations at the Swedish
railway company (SJ) was down during the entire day, Wednesday 28 Oct 1998.
Phone ticket sales, normally serving 15,000 customers every day, were
completely shut down and at local sales offices only fare tickets without
reservations could be purchased.  The company press information officer
explains: ``There was a hardware failure in the mainframe supporting our
entire system.  This also caused the backup computer to fail.''

A new Swedish law which makes most of the Internet illegal in Sweden took
effect yesterday. The law is named personal information handling law. It
makes much of the publication of information about individual persons on the
Internet illegal, such as criticism of named persons, publication of lists
of references in scientific papers or the sending of e-mail messages outside
of Europe.

(note: The Swedish government will probably not use the law to stop
Internet. This law and other laws like it have made me understand that laws
are not meant to be obeyed.)

Question: All other EU countries are to enact similar laws.  Have other
countries interpreted the EU directive in the same way, and developed laws
which would make most of the Internet illegal?

The risks of Automated Mailing Software....

Embarrassed council officials have apologised for asking the occupant of a
village cemetery to fill in a survey.  A questionnaire from Rushcliffe
Borough Council asked 'The Occupier, Burial Ground' in Flintham, Notts, if
he or she had been a victim of crime in the last 12 months or belonged to a
Neighbourhood Watch Scheme.  The wrongly-addressed letter was among 2,000
sent out to businesses in the area as part of a survey to pinpoint concerns
over crime and vandalism.  But a council spokesman admitted: 'There is not
much chance of a reply being received from the occupant there.'  [...]

&gt; The absence of both voice-mail and call-forwarding
&gt; certainly makes life tough.

But simpler, I should think â€” it certainly does in my life.  Indeed, on an
occasion when several hundred persons (including me) lost computer service
at our desktops at work for ten days, work life in our building became
extremely simple, if at a rather higher emotional voltage.

At home we used to have an answering machine, but my wife â€” more or less a
technophobe â€” hated it, so I disconnected it.  Since then I tell people
that our not having an answering machine is a service to our callers,
subtly signalling them that we either are away or don't wish to answer the
phone, thereby saving them the connection charges.

Yes (as noted by many readers), I was unable to disremember some of the
earlier confusion between the British BILLION and the American BILLION.  In
the olden dayes in England (until a few decades ago), the Brits commonly
used the European MILLIARD which is equivalent to the American BILLION, with
their BILLION equivalent to the American TRILLION.  Apparently the Brits
have informally switched in common usage, although the French and Germans
still use the MILLIARD.  The confusion is commonly resolved by referring to
a thousand million or a million million.  Perhaps the Euro presents an
opportunity to standardize, but I have not heard any such news.

%T   "Democracy and Technology"

"This book promotes the reconstruction of technology along more democratic
lines.  [...]  Insofar as (1) citizens ought to be empowered to participate
in shaping their society's basic circumstances and (2) technologies
profoundly affect and partly constitute those circumstances, it follows that
(3) technological design and practice should be democratized."  Personally,
I can sympathize with the aims, and even the thesis, that the author
proposes for this text.  However, he also notes a personal experience that
taught him "that even the most well-intentioned, elite study group can be
deeply unaware of the extent to which its conclusions embody far-reaching
value judgements."  What Sclove seems to have missed is the fact that
however important your ideas may be, they have to be communicated to those
who may have different backgrounds, and also have to be backed up by some
kind of evidence.  Although the declamations may be impassioned, only the
most sympathetic and dedicated reader will be able to plow through the
prose; and the arguments, as they proceed, have little support beyond force
of personality.

Part one is intended to synthesize modern research in the social dimensions
of technology and democratic theory into a rudimentary but comprehensive
democratic theory of technology.  Chapter one, using a statistical sampling
of two communities (one of which is oversimplified into caricature) states
that technology affects society, but that society can choose those
technologies that it will accept.  The idea that technology affects society
is re-examined in greater detail and verbiage in chapter two.  Democratic
decision-making is said to be superior in chapter three, and some objections
are replied to.  Unfortunately, this entire section is based on only four
real examples, and those situations include one failure, one closed and
homogeneous community, and two "megaprojects" requiring massive, formal
bureaucratic and political decisions.  The theory eventually turned out is
extremely rudimentary: it states that technology should be democratized, but
fails to determine whether it can be.

Part two proposes a set of evaluation points that can be used to review
technologies for compatibility with democracy.  Chapter four is supposed to
look at technologies of community, but concentrates primarily on work
situations.  In this regard it weakens the arguments of part one in that
examples are given of cooperative social structures (successfully) imposed
on hierarchical work environments, and democratically designed work
technologies subsumed to a centralized corporate structure.  When the topic
does finally turn to a purer consideration of community it is to
dismissively denigrate the possibility of technological support of virtual
community.  Democratic work is said to be free of routine and inflexible
schedules, but chapter five singularly fails to say how this utopian state
of affairs is to be accomplished.  The first of three discussions of
politics, chapter six proposes that technologies that promote distorted
ideologies or exacerbate social inequities be avoided.  Actually, though,
the material hardly touches on any example technologies at all.  Two of the
points in chapter seven boil down to "smaller is prettier" since
technologies with a smaller scope of impact promote local self-governance.
The third, however, is rather vague.  We are to prefer technologies that
promote decentralization and federation, without any real ideas of what
those are.  (There is also no analysis of the relative importance of
self-governance versus federation, a debate that my Canadian heritage finds
most compelling.)  The first point in chapter eight is that we should not
foul our own nests, and I assume that most would agree with that; the only
problem being the determination of how strictly to adhere to it.  The
second, however, seems to be an almost religious insistence on flexibility.
For the perpetuation of a species we might note that adaptability is a good
thing, but technology can be managed by the species (that is, us) according
to changing conditions.  Is the slotted screw somehow morally superior to
the Robertson because slotted screwdrivers can be used as (rather clumsy)
chisels?

Part three is a defence of the democratic politics of technology against
traditional economic models.  Chapter nine appears to want to eliminate the
concept of value from the discussion.  Economic theory is not actually
challenged in chapter ten.  Instead it is turned into a straw-philosophy,
"economism," and attacked as unfit for comparison with social justice.  I
fully agree with the kind of participatory inventiveness that chapter eleven
espouses, which used to go by the name of amateur scholarship.  It cannot,
however, be successfully mandated: it must be self-driven.  This has to be
obvious from the examples given in the chapter which are almost universally
either proper systems analysis stories or failures.  Chapter twelve purports
to lay out a roadmap for pursuing more democratic technologies, but is
weakened by a vast majority of statements that use "could" or "might" rather
than "will."  Sclove does admit to a number of important social factors that
work against his ideals (at least in the United States) in chapter thirteen,
but finishes by only hoping that they can be overcome.

This book is forceful, turgid, passionate, dull, and verbose.  At first
reading, I thought that the nine criteria for evaluation of technologies
were the most important part of the work.  However, as an exercise I tried
reviewing some processes.  War and weapons technologies came out
surprisingly well, marred only by a tendency to perpetuate authoritarian
structures.  Guerilla or sectarian violence came out even better.  Again, I
am in full agreement with the general aims of the book, but have to conclude
that a lot more work needs to be done on the specifics.

%T   "Windows NT Server 4 Security Handbook"

Part one is an overview, both of security and Windows NT.  Chapter one's
presentation of security basics has many good points, but also some
unfortunate gaps and errors.  The review of security concepts in NT provides
a good grounding in how the matter is seen from Microsoft's perspective in
chapter two.  (It also has a rather interesting quick introduction to
firewalls.)  The NT architecture overview in chapter three does not really
concentrate on security topics.  When it does, the coverage of access
control is reasonably clear, if not terribly readable.

The Implementation of security, in part two, explains individual functions
well but does not provide conceptual frameworks for security operations.
Most of the material does provide the ideas behind a feature, but then
simply follows through the screens for turning it on.  Topics include
domains, trust relationships, NTFS (New Technology File System) security,
protecting domain resources, and NT Workstation security.  Somewhat
different is chapter six, which gives a thorough tutorial on internal user
authentication procedures.

Part three walks through the implementation of a master domain network.
Chapters cover planning, implementation steps, and configuration of trust
relationships, but the material is too brief for a realistic guide.  Part
four looks at security for various related products, such as BackOffice,
NetWare, Macintosh, Internet, and UNIX.  Again, there are more mentions than
working details.  Part five first explains and then walks you through
implementation for C-2 security configuration.

Of those I have reviewed to date, this book delves deepest into many areas
of NT security and protection.  However, it still does not draw back the
shroud surrounding the NT security model.  The explanations of operations
are clear and there is much useful information, but still no clear direction
to the besieged sysadmin.

Coming of Age    Formal Aspects of Computing at 21
2nd December 1998, British Royal Society

The 21st anniversary of the British Computer Society Formal
Aspects of Computing Science Special Interest Group

To mark this coming of age, we have invited four of our distinguished
Fellows of the British Royal Society to select highlights of current
research achievements, reflect on past lessons learned and look forward to
future directions.

      Mike Gordon     21 Years of Hardware Verification
      Tony Hoare      Top-down and bottom-up and meeting in the middle
      Robin Milner    Computing is Interaction
      Gordon Plotkin  On Syntax

This 21-year period has seen formal methods mature from inception as a
purely academic research area, to establish itself in computer science
curricula, and most recently to be practically applied in industry.

The FACS at 21 meeting will take place at The Royal Society, 6 Carlton House
Terrace, London, commencing 9.30 am and finishing by 5.00 pm. In addition,
there will be an opportunity to attend an evening meal attended by the
speakers. (Registration form below.)
