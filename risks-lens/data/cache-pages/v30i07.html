  The country's top intelligence official said Thursday that Russia's
  meddling in the 2016 election consisted of hacking, as well as the
  spreading of traditional propaganda and "fake news."  "That's classical
  tradecraft that the Russians have long used," said Director of National
  Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr, testifying before the Senate Armed
  Services Committee on foreign cyber threats, and especially Russian
  hacking and interference in the election ...  A classified report on
  Russian intelligence interference in the election has been prepared for
  President Obama, who is due to receive it Thursday.  Clapper said that
  intelligence officials "plan to brief the congress and release an
  unclassified version of this report to the public early next week."

  Hacking is here:

  An NBC report last night touted "An exclusive, inside look" at the report
  connecting the Russian government to breaches of Democratic National
  Convention and other servers during election season sourced to two
  intelligence community sources.  The NBC broadcast included claims that
  Russia attacked the White House and that Russian had dual motives in the
  attack of disrupting the campaign and revenge on the Obama administration
  for delegitimizing Russian President Vladimir Putin throughout his
  administration.

  WikiLeaks is taking heat for saying it wants to publish the private
  information of hundreds of thousands of verified Twitter users.  A Twitter
  account associated with the group said an online database would include
  such sensitive details as family relationships and finances.

  The most powerful publication in the world today is Donald Trump's
  personal Twitter account. In the past six weeks, it has moved markets,
  conducted shadow foreign policy, and reshaped the focus of media around
  the world. Just today, it caused Toyota's stock to drop. It is also
  shockingly insecure.  That insecurity was acceptable when @realDonaldTrump
  concerned itself with Kristen Stewart cheating on Robert Pattinson and how
  thin people don't drink Diet Coke. And yet Trump's newfound influence --
  combined with the unpredictability of his tweetsâ€”makes the
  president-elect's account a particularly tempting target for hackers.
  That's especially true because there is a large fortune that could be made
  in a single 140-character message.  If someone were able to gain access to
  Trump's Twitter, they could tweet approvingly or disapprovingly about a
  company (as Trump has done) and play the stock market accordinglyâ€”or
  cause others to do so. A market-tracking app called Trigger has already
  set up an alert that responds whenever Trump tweets about publicly traded
  companies.

Ellen Barry, *The New York Times*, 3 Jan 2017

Thane, Indiaâ€”Betsy Broder, who tracks international fraud at the Federal
Trade Commission, was in her office in Washington last summer when she got a
call from two Indian teenagers.

Calling from a high-rise building in a suburb of Mumbai, they told her, in
tones that were alternately earnest and melodramatic, that they wanted to
share the details of a sprawling criminal operation targeting Americans.
Ms. Broder, who was no stranger to whistle-blowers, pressed the young men
for details.

â€œHe said his name was Adam,'' she said, referring to one of the pair.  I
said, â€œYour name is not Adam. What does your grandmother call you?''  He
said, â€œBabu.''

Babu was Jayesh Dubey, a skinny 19-year-old with hair gelled into vertical
bristles, a little like a chimney brush. He told her that he was working in
a seven-story building and that everyone there was engaged in the same
activity: impersonating Internal Revenue Service officials and threatening
Americans, demanding immediate payment to cover back taxes.

  OMICS is also in the less well-known business of what might be called
  conference fraud, which is what led to the call from John. Both schemes
  exploit a fundamental weakness of modern higher education: Academics need

  According to the ESET researchers, the way the KillDisk ransomware version
  work on Windows and Linux is completely different, with the biggest issue
  being that on Linux, KillDisk doesn't save the encryption key anywhere on
  disk or online.  Normally, this would mean that victims would never be
  able to recover files since the encryption key would be lost immediately
  after the encryption process ends.  The good news is that ESET researchers
  say they've uncovered a flaw in the Linux variant that permits them to
  recover the encrypted files. The same weakness does not exist in the
  version that targets Windows PCs.

    [Various sources indicate that ransomware took a huge leap in 2016,
    perhaps quadrupling in frequency, with estimated profits on the order
    of a billion dollars.  For example, see

A San Diego TV station sparked complaints this weekâ€”after an on-air
report about a girl who ordered a dollhouse via her parents' Amazon Echo
caused Echoes in viewers' homes to also attempt to order dollhouses.

Telly station CW-6 said the blunder happened during a Thursday morning news
package about a Texan six-year-old who racked up big charges while talking
to an Echo gadget in her home. According to her parents' Amazon account,
their daughter said: "Can you play dollhouse with me and get me a
dollhouse?" Next thing they knew, a $160 KidKraft Sparkle Mansion dollhouse
and four pounds of sugar cookies arrived on their doorstep.

During that story's segment, a CW-6 news presenter remarked: "I love the
little girl, saying 'Alexa ordered me a dollhouse'."

That, apparently, was enough to set off Alexa-powered Echo boxes around San
Diego on their own shopping sprees. The California station admitted plenty
of viewers complained that the TV broadcast caused their voice-controlled
personal assistants to try to place orders for dollhouses on Amazon.

We'll take this opportunity to point out that voice-command purchasing is
enabled by default on Alexa devices. [...]

Federal regulators have accused D-Link, a manufacturer of popular networking
and smart-home products, of leaving its routers and webcam devices
vulnerable to hackers.

A lawsuit, filed this morning in a U.S. District Court in San Francisco by
the Federal Trade Commission, alleges that China-based D-Link and its
U.S. partner â€œfailed to take reasonable steps to protect their routers and
IP cameras from widely known and reasonably foreseeable risks of
unauthorized access.''

The FTC contends that D-Link chose to not secure these devices against flaws
that have been considered critical for nearly a decade. These
vulnerabilities, alleges the complaint, are easily preventable but can also
be easily taken advantage of if left unfixed.

In addition to leaving devices open to hacking, the lawsuit claims that
D-Link elected to not secure users' mobile app login credentials, but
â€œinstead have stored those credentials in clear, readable text on a user's
mobile device.''

in the library of the state psychiatric hospital, while he was a patient

the mechanisms of access, but security was tightened on the "public" library

Politics of Hidden Internet Interventionism

As framed by the media theorist Manuel Castells, we should not overlook the
oldest and most direct form of media politics: propaganda and control. This
is: (a) the fabrication and diffusion of messages that distort facts and
induce misinformation for the purpose of advancing government interests; and
(b) the censorship of any message deemed to undermine these interests, if
necessary by criminalizing unhindered communication and prosecuting the
messenger.  [...]

Why must everything be "smart"â€”aka "spying"â€”aka "hackable" ?

What really galls me is the fact that the Public Utilities Commissions
(PUC's) can force us all to pay for this crap, so these dimwits at the
electric utilities can put another notch in their LinkedIn resume belts
(i.e., something else that I have failed at: "cybersecurity").

I'd much rather have the money spent on *rooftop solar* and *distributed
battery systems*, which would vastly improve resilience over the existing
centralized single-point-of-failure grid system.

<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/29/smart-electricity-meters-dangerously-insecure-hackers">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/29/smart-electricity-meters-dangerously-insecure-hackers</a>

Smart electricity meters can be dangerously insecure, warns expert

Hackers can cause fraud, explosions and house fires, and utility companies
should do more to protect consumers, conference told

Alex Hern in Hamburg, 29 Dec 2016 (modified 30 Dec 2016)

Smart electricity meters, of which there are more than 100m installed around
the world, are frequently "dangerously insecure", a security expert has
said.

The lack of security in the smart utilities raises the prospect of a single
line of malicious code cutting power to a home or even causing a
catastrophic overload leading to exploding meters or house fires, according
to Netanel Rubin, co-founder of the security firm Vaultra.

"Reclaim your home," Rubin told a conference of hackers and security
experts, "or someone else will."

If a hacker took control of a smart meter they would be able to know
"exactly when and how much electricity you're using", Rubin told the 33rd
Chaos Communications Congress in Hamburg.  An attacker could also see
whether a home had any expensive electronics.

"He can do billing fraud, setting your bill to whatever he likes ...  The
scary thing is if you think about the power they have over your electricity.
He will have power over all of your smart devices connected to the
electricity.  This will have more severe consequences: imagine you woke up
to find you'd been robbed by a burglar who didn't have to break in.

"But even if you don't have smart devices, you are still at risk.  An
attacker who controls the meter also controls the meter's software, allowing
him to cause it to literally explode."

Rubin said many of the warnings were not hypothetical.  In 2009 Puerto Rican
smart meters were hacked en masse, leading to widespread billing fraud, and
in 2015 a house fire in Ontario was traced back to a faulty smart meter,
although hacking was not implicated in that.

The problems at the heart of the insecurity stem from outdated protocols,
half-hearted implementations and weak design principles.  While the physical
security of smart meters is strongâ€”"trust me, I tried" to hack in that
way, Rubin saidâ€”the wireless protocols many of them use are problematic.

To communicate with the utility company, most smart meters use GSM, the 2G
mobile standard.  That has a fairly well-known weakness whereby an attacker
with a fake mobile tower can cause devices to "hand over" to the fake
version from the real tower, simply by providing a strong signal.  In GSM,
devices have to authenticate with towers, but not the other way round,
allowing the fake mast to send its own commands to the meter.

Worse still, said Rubin, all the meters from one utility used the same
hardcoded credentials.  "If an attacker gains access to one meter, it gains
access to them all.  It is the one key to rule them all."

Inside the home, too, the communications are rendered insecure by outdated
standards and bad implementation.  Almost all smart meters use the Zigbee
standard to speak to other smart devices in the home.

Zigbee, which dates from 2003, is a popular home automation standard, used
for controlling everything from lightbulbs to air conditioners.  But it is
so convoluted, due to the vast array of devices supported, that it is almost
better to think of it as 15 different standards, each of which vendors can
choose to implement as they see fit.

"This unique situation is so difficult to implement, vendors actually choose
what they want to implement.  And when they choose what to support, they
more often than not skip security," Rubin said.

Other weak security decisions made by vendors include:

* Encryption keys derived from short (often just six-character) device names.

* Pairing standards with no authentication required, allowing an attacker to
  simply ask the smart meter to join the network and receive keys in return.

* Hardcoded credentials, allowing administrator access with passwords as
  simple and guessable as the vendor's name.

* Code simplified to work on low-power devices skipping important checks,
  allowing nothing more than a long communication to crash the device.

"These security problems are not going to just go away," Rubin said.  "On
the contrary, we are going to see a sharp increase in hacking attempts.  Yet
most utilities are not even monitoring their network, let alone the smart
meters.  Utilities have to understand that with great power comes great
responsibility."

Smart meters come with benefits, allowing utilities to more efficiently
allocate energy production, and enabling micro-generation that can boost the
uptake of renewable energy.  For those reasons and more, the European Union
has a goal of replacing 80% of meters with smart meters by 2020.

A spokesperson for the UK government's department of Business, Energy and
Industrial Strategy said: "Robust security controls are in place across the
end to end smart metering system and all devices must be independently
assessed by an expert security organisation, irrespective of their country
of origin."

  anonymity fail to consistently improve online community behavior - forcing
  real names in online communities could also increase discrimination and
  worsen harassment.  We need to change our entire approach to the
  question. Our concerns about anonymity are overly-simplistic; system
  design can't solve social problems without actual social change.

Here's a quick update on an item I shared in <a href="http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/27/72">RISKS-27.72</a> in Jan 2014 [1].

The risk was about *name collisions* in the Domain Name System (DNS). Name
collisions can occur when a domain name assumed to be reserved for internal
use within a home or corporate networkâ€”a name like "printer.corp" --
becomes available for registration and external use within the global
Internet.  When such a collision occurs, an internal system, rather than
sending traffic to an internal resource as intended, may unknowingly send it
instead to a new external resource with the same name. If a malicious user
controls that external resource, the malicious user may be able to acquire
sensitive data and even inject false responses - all without ever breaching
internal network defenses.

The risk of name collisions increased dramatically with the launch of
ICANN's New Generic Top-Level Domains (gTLD) Program, which has just
recently added its 1,000th new top-level domain (TLD) to the global DNS
[2]. As Verisign Labs showed in research reports [3] starting in 2013, many
of the potential new TLDs overlapped with established internal-use
names. This research motivated additional analysis within the New gTLD
Program, as well as further research within the Internet community on both
the prevalence of the problem and potential solutions (including the
workshop I mentioned in my previous post - see IETF RFC 8023 [4] for a
summary).

On the positive side, there's now much more awareness of the risk within the
research community. ICANN now requires that a top-level domain pass through
a new risk mitigation process called "controlled interruption" before it can
be added to the global DNS.

But on the negative side, name collisions are indeed occurring. Researchers
at University of Michigan and Verisign Labs showed in an IEEE Security and
Privacy paper [5] that an increasing number of externally registered names
overlap with internal names employed in the Web Proxy Auto-Discovery (WPAD)
protocol. As reported in this forum last May [6], an adversary could
potentially exploit such a collision to launch a Man in the Middle (MiTM)
attack. US-CERT issued an alert [7] with advice on how users and network
administrators can reduce the risk.

It will be interesting to see how all this plays out, especially in terms of
mitigations.

It's not just local authorities, it's also tax collectors, according
to *The Telegraph* today:

<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/tax/return/taxman-unleashes-snooper-computer-information-does-have/">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/tax/return/taxman-unleashes-snooper-computer-information-does-have/</a>

  Taxman unleashes its 'snooper computer': what information does it have on
  you?

  HM Revenue &amp; Customs has spent years and £100m or more on a
  super-computer designed to identify those who may have paid too little
  tax.

  The Connect system crunches data from Airbnb, the rental platform, for
  instance, or eBay. It can also access Land Registry records to see houses
  purchased and ensure the correct tax has been paid. From there, further
  sources enable it to determine if properties are being rented out and
  whether that income has been declared.

  It can also determine if someone is likely to be able to afford such
  properties, or whether they are suspected of having used previously
  undeclared income or savings.

  HMRC gains anonymised information on all Visa and Mastercard transactions,
  enabling it to identify areas of likely underpayments which it can then
  target further, seeking details of individuals' transactions where
  necessary.

  HMRC will also be one of the government bodies to gain access to
  information under new laws known commonly as the *snoopers' charter*.  The
  legislation means telecom providers store customers' web browsing and
  email records for at least a year; it can then be accessed by the
  Government.

Rather obvious RISKS of getting in trouble for routine mistakes and
mess-ups, plus drawing the wrong inferences from multiple data sources.
Looks like us Brits should be prepared to just hand ourselves in...
