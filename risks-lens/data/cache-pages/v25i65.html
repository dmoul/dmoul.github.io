The United States has no clear military policy about how the nation might
respond to a cyberattack on its communications, financial or power networks,
a panel of scientists and policy advisers warned Wednesday, and the country
needs to clarify both its offensive capabilities and how it would respond to
such attacks.  The report, Technology, Policy, Law, and Ethics Regarding
U.S. Acquisition and Use of Cyberattack Capabilities, is based on a
three-year study by a panel assembled by the National Academy of Sciences,
and is the first major effort to look at the military use of computer
technologies as weapons. The potential use of such technologies offensively
has been widely discussed in recent years, and disruptions of communications
systems and Web sites have become a standard occurrence in both political
and military conflicts since 2000.  [Source: John Markoff and Thom Shanker,

  [Please browse the entire article, which includes a link to the free
  Executive Summary of the draft NRC CSTB report, written by an impeccable
  cast of characters; the 14 authors include Adm. William A. Owens, William
  O. Studeman, Walter B. Slocombe, Richard Garwin, as well as some very
  technically savvy folks such as Tom Berson, David Clark, Jerry Saltzer,
  and Mark Seiden who are well-known to long-time RISKS readers.  Ken Dam
  (co-chair with Owens) was also co-chair with David Clark of the report
  Computers at Risk: Safe Computing in the Information Age (1990).  There's
  also a long history of reports in between that deserve greater recognition
  in policy circles, including Trust in Cyberspace (1998) and Toward a Safer
  and More Secure Cyberspace (2007).  (Disclaimer: Although I was a
  co-author of the 1990 and 2007 studies [a locust who emerges every 17
  years?], the most relevant fact here is that those reports were not read
  and understood enough by people who really needed to know, and that not
  much has changed sufficiently in the interim.)

Many of us frequently lambaste the media for their scare tactics.  For a
change, CNN got it right today, putting the flu scare in proportion.

&gt; Regular flu has killed thousands since January

&gt; There had been no confirmed deaths in the United States related to swine
&gt; flu as of [`until' would now be correct] Tuesday afternoon.  But another
&gt; virus had killed thousands of people since January and is expected to
&gt; keep killing hundreds of people every week for the rest of the year.
&gt;
&gt; That one? The regular flu.
&gt;
&gt; [...]  But even if there are swine-flu deaths outside Mexico â€” and
&gt; medical experts say there very well may be â€” the virus would have a long
&gt; way to go to match the roughly 36,000 deaths that seasonal influenza
&gt; causes in the United States each year.  [...]

Now if only the media can be convinced to use the same level-headed risk
analysis when it comes to technology risks....

On 27 Apr 2009, President Barack Obama promised a major investment in
research and development for scientific innovation, saying the United States
has fallen behind others.  At a speech at the annual meeting of the National
Academy of Sciences, he said "I believe it is not in our character, American
character, to follow â€” but to lead. And it is time for us to lead once
again. I am here today to set this goal: we will devote more than 3 percent
of our GDP to research and development.  We will not just meet but we will
exceed the level achieved at the height of the space race."  [...]

  [I hope some of this gets devoted to radically improving our information
  infrastructures.  That's certainly an old running theme in RISKS.  PGN]

... and Lockheed claims to be super smart about computers..

Computer spies have broken into the Pentagon's $300 billion Joint Strike
Fighter project â€” the Defense Department's costliest weapons program ever
-- according to current and former government officials familiar with the
attacks.  Similar incidents have also breached the Air Force's
air-traffic-control system in recent months, these people say. In the case
of the fighter-jet program, the intruders were able to copy and siphon off
several terabytes of data related to design and electronics systems,
officials say, potentially making it easier to defend against the craft.
...  The intruders entered through vulnerabilities in the networks of two or
three contractors helping to build the high-tech fighter jet, according to
people who have been briefed on the matter. Lockheed Martin is the lead
contractor on the program, and Northrop Grumman Corp. and BAE Systems PLC
also play major roles in its development.  [*Wall Street Journal*, 21 Apr 2009]

Pencils, not pixels: Ireland scuttles electronic voting machines --
Faced with rising costs and growing fears of hackers, Ireland has decided to
join a growing movement in Europe to return to old school voting practices.

For sale: 7,500 electronic voting machines. Never used.  Will need retrofit
for security. Cost: $67 million, but all offers considered. Contact Irish
government.

Bought in the midst of the booming Celtic Tiger economy, these Dutch-built
Nedap Powervote system machines were technologically chíc. Piloted in three
constituencies during the 2002 general election, they were expected to
eliminate lengthy manual counts and parse votes from Ireland's complicated
proportional representation system to give instant results.  And if Ireland
didn't embrace e-voting, warned then Taoiseach Prime Minister Bertie Ahern
in 2006, the country would be a laughing stock "with our stupid oul
pencils," he said, using an Irish colloquialism for "old."  But the stupid
oul pencils have had the last laugh. Ireland is now selling its unused
machines, which thus far have incurred storage fees of [the equivalent of
$4.6 million].  [Source: Michael Seaver, 26 Apr 2009, *Christian Science

<i>Wed, 29 Apr 2009 08:43:07 +0200</i><pre>

The city of Berlin held a referendum this past weekend on a complicated
question about whether religion can be a substitute for ethics as a
compulsory subject in the schools. It was a bitter campaign and the maps
showing the precinct's results clearly showed where the Berlin Wall used to
be: Western Berlin voted "yes", Eastern Berlin voted "no", and "no" won.

On Monday they had top 10 lists of the precincts that voted one way or the
other. I thought that the top "yes" precinct, in trendy Wilmersdorf, did
smell a bit fishy with 99,5 %. But well, okay, that's where all the Germans
that emigrated from Russia live, and they are used to voting that way. The
party's way or no way.

Today the newspapers report on a "statistical error". The results are
counted in the precincts and reported by telephone to the central
office. You redial and redial and redial, until some harried person answers,
and then you give them your results.

Instead of "415 votes, 225 for yes, 188 for no, 2 invalid", what was
recorded in the computer for this precinct was "416 votes, 414 for yes, 1
for no, 1 invalid". And this information is automatically passed on to the
next station.

I don't see a statistical error here - I see an input validation problem and
antiquated data input methods. And I find it disturbing that the total
number of votes is wrong, too.

Perhaps they can switch to text messages for the next election?

on Wednesday for debate."  Full story at:

Beside the usual questions and argument about IP vs. human rights, there is
also the question of enforcement: How on earth can any legal system
(democratic and sane one, anyway) ban a person from access to the net?
ISP's deal with Internet accounts, which are not "persons" in the legal
sense; I'm not a lawyer, but I cannot think of any legal mechanism which can
make a binding and enforcible connection between these terms.

Two bills were introduced into the US Senate on 1 Apr 2009 that I believe
are intended to guide cybersecurity policy for the US.

* S 773 - A bill to ensure the continued free flow of commerce within the
United States and with its global trading partners through secure cyber
communications, to provide for the continued development and exploitation of
the Internet and intranet communications for such purposes, to provide for
the development of a cadre of information technology specialists to improve
and maintain effective cybersecurity defenses against disruption, and for
other purposes.

  Full Text: <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:S.778:">http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:S.778:</a>

The status of S773 shows that it was read twice on 1 Apr and referred to the
Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.
(<a href="http://commerce.senate.gov/public/">http://commerce.senate.gov/public/</a>) It was the chairman of that committee,
Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) that sponsored the bill.

Considering this was introduced by a Democratic Committee Chairman in a
Democratic-controlled Congress with a Democratic President, it seems likely
that some version of it will be passed.  I urge the RISKS community to take
a close look at the bill to see that it achieve the security we require
without unduly compromising the privacy we are guaranteed by the
Constitution and by Common Law.  If changes should be made, it will be
easier to get them done sooner rather than later.

Here are a few quick comments on two items that I noticed.  By no means have
I read it all.

  ===========================
Sec 14(b): The Secretary of Commerce--
  (1) shall have access to all relevant data concerning such networks
without regard to any provision of law, regulation, rule, or policy
restricting such access;
 - --------------
NOTE: "such networks" here refers to "Federal Government and private sector
owned critical infrastructure information systems and networks.".  In Sec
23, "Federal Government and United States critical infrastructure
information systems and networks" is defined as all Federal Government
information systems and networks plus "state, local, and nongovernmental
information systems and networks in the United States designated by the
President as critical infrastructure information systems and networks"

In other words, it means any networks the government wants it to mean, such
as, say, the ISP network serving your home system, or the network at your
church.  All it takes is the President's designation.  The only reason I can
think of for the slightly different naming ("private sector" vs "United
States") is either sloppiness or removing the restriction that the network
is "in the United States" and extending it to "private sector" so it might
apply to a US company's network outside the US.

My biggest concern is the "without regard to any provision of law".  Does
this mean this law trumps all other laws?  Does it mean that the Federal
Government claims access to (and jurisdiction over) any network, even if it
does not otherwise comes under federal jurisdiction (through Interstate
Commerce, etc.).

 = ===========================
SEC. 17. AUTHENTICATION AND CIVIL LIBERTIES REPORT.

Within 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the President, or the
President's designee, shall review, and report to Congress, on the
feasibility of an identity management and authentication program, with the
appropriate civil liberties and privacy protections, for government and
critical infrastructure information systems and networks.
  - ----------
This is poorly (or is it expertly?) worded in that is ambiguous what
identities are being managed.  Individuals (as indicated by the references
to civil liberties and privacy) or systems and networks ("identity
management...program ... for government... systems and networks")

Paragraph 5: "CATA is tapping the software-as-a-service offering of
Calgary-based JITR Inc. Its JET system lets any company or organization

Is there anyone else who saw "JITR" and immediately thought "jitter".  The
whole name could turn into "jittering".  Not the best association for

I heard the same episode of car talk and remember the car affected being the
Nissan Versa &lt;not Vesta *&gt;.  I am fairly confident in my memory because the
Versa is a vehicle that my wife and I considered buying a while back, but
rejected because when the back seats were folded down, they made a two to
three inch step between them and the trunk area (very impractical for
loading large objects) that none of the other hatchbacks we looked at had.

Listening to Click and Clack's NSA interference hypothesis, I was
reminded of an earlier automotive RFI problem.

Our 1968 Volvo used a voltage regulator to supply the temperature and fuel
gauges.  Approaching a radar cop, the regulator swamped and as the engine
overheated, the gas tank filled up (according to the needles).  It got one's
attention.

A built-in radar detector, disguised as necessary instruments!

Unfortunately, the effect didn't begin until about 30 feet from the radar.

My wife and I flew to Denver last fall and rented a Toyota Camry.  We drove
all over Wyoming and Montana, and in Yellowstone and Grand Teton NP the tire
sensors showed low pressure.  When I checked the tires, they were a little
low, but not bad.  Then the Check Engine light came when we were at Jackson
Lodge and I called the Hertz facility at the Denver airport.  The manager
asked me to take it to the Hertz venue in the Jackson Hole airport.  When I
explained the issue to the manager there, he told me that telecommunications
in the area for Vice President Cheney set off car sensors all the time.  He
said he could give me a new car, but the warnings would probably come back.
I was skeptical about this, but now I wonder if he was right.

In <a href="/Risks/25/64">RISKS-25.64</a> Dick Mills suggests that if all closed source software was
opened, there would not be enough benevolent hackers to find the bugs before
the malevolent hackers do - concluding that it would be disastrous.

I'm not convinced. Much software has been opened sourced to date, including
significant code bases of Solaris (~10MLoC), OpenOffice (7.6MLoC) and much
of Java (~6.5MLoC) - large code bases that are in significant use in many
environments world-wide.

Java is estimated to be installed in 5.4B devices - I imagine that this is a
sizable target that malevolent hackers would be working on. But should they
find a flaw and exploit it, there will be many companies and individuals
looking to close the case quickly.

It is also doubtful that all propriety software would be opened at the same
time, allowing more eyes to look through code should they be inclined to do
so.

Microsoft software, however, is a special case as Dick indicates.

Similarly, encryption algorithms also suffer from a lack of confidence due
to closed designs. An open development process is more likely to find flaws
sooner and therefore reduce the risk of insecure data transmission.

Many people who advocate or condemn security through obscurity misunderstand
it.  The notion goes back to Kerckhoff's 1883 paper on military cryptography.
He did not, however, advocate publishing the system.  Rather, he wrote "The
system must not require secrecy and can be stolen by the enemy without
causing trouble" (translation from
<a href="http://www.petitcolas.net/fabien/kerckhoffs/">http://www.petitcolas.net/fabien/kerckhoffs/</a>).  That is, it should be secure
even if compromised.

The real issue is whether one gains more security by publishing (the "many
eyes" theory) or by keeping it secret (and thus perhaps increasing the work
effort for the attacker).  I don't think there's any one answer.  In
cryptography, I strongly suspect that cryptanalysis is *much* harder without
access to the algorithm â€” but we also know that it's been done.  Source
code is probably more secure if published â€” but if and only if enough
competent good guys are actually motivated to examine it.  For voting
machines, I think that that's likely the case; for other systems, it's much
less clear.  (We also know how long some serious security bugs have lurked
in open source systems --
<a href="http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-95.03.telnet.encryption.vulnerability">http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-95.03.telnet.encryption.vulnerability</a> is
my favorite, for many reasons.)

In <a href="/Risks/25/64">RISKS-25.64</a>, Dick Mills writes that he's not convinced that Security By
Obscurity is really a myth.  He makes the point that the banks do it, so it
must be good.  Interestingly, in a previous article in the same digest, we
learn that banks have some really serious security problems because their
security model for ATM card PINs is much more vulnerable than they'd
anticipated.  Based on what I've heard of these exploits elsewhere in the
press, their security model would have been roundly mocked if it had been
public knowledge; in this case, clearly obscurity benefited no-one except
the attackers.

&gt; From: Dick Mills &lt;dickandlibbymills@gmail.com&gt;...
&gt;
&gt; In <a href="/Risks/25/61">RISKS-25.61</a>, John Sebes reiterated the expert's condemnation of
&gt; security by obscurity (SBO).  I for one, would certainly not challenge the
&gt; validity of what Mr. Sebes and others say â€” within context. ...

I, on the other hand, might...

The notion of security by obscurity as often portrayed as a bad thing, and
while I certainly think that covering up weak concepts, designs,
implementations, and executions by trying to obscure them is a bad idea, the
facts on the ground are that very few programs are properly and formally
specified to a level of detail where we can even determine whether or not
they meet those specifications at all, much modern programming is
evolutionary in nature and hooks into something else that is largely unknown
by the programmer, most organizations I have seen are unable or unwilling to
put in the resources to do things to a level of surety that would allow full
disclosure of everything, and I see no reason that obscurity is any less
valid than complexity in terms of defining the security properties of a
system.

How many from the RISKS audience would really provide me with all of the
information that all of the people in their organization have about
everything in the organization along with a mandate to do harm, and expect
that I would do no better than I would do if provided with the mandate and
none of the information?

Security by obscurity is a fact of risk management, and it is often the only
reasonable approach to mitigation of risks.

&gt; Given that we know that perimeter defenses are ineffective illusions in
&gt; cyberspace, ...

Actually, this is just plain untrue. Perimeter defenses are almost all of
the defenses we have that actually do work - in that they do things that we
can measure and they do them effectively. So this "given" should be taken
away.

To be clear, the fact that perimeters are "leaky" by intent, does not mean
that they are not effective. To the extent that the writer was deceived
about what these defenses do, the cognitive problems with people
understanding perimeter defenses should be addresses as well.  To aide a bit
in this...

Perimeter defenses primarily operate to reduce the quantity and types of
event sequences that cross the boundary defined by the perimeter.  As an
example, process separation is a perimeter defense that puts a perimeter
around a process and its resources and limits the ways in which information
can cross that perimeter. It works very well in preventing processes from
writing all over other processes' memory, but it does not, and is not
intended to, prevent the use and abuse of system calls that communicate
across the boundary. The perimeter defense associated with identification
and authentication is defined by the authorization process. In this case,
the perimeter might be, as an example, the division between those input
sequences that are allowed to interface with programs other than the login
program and other similar service programs and those that cannot. Again, it
is effective at what it does, but it does not prevent an individual who
takes over the keyboard from an already authorized user from using those
interfaces. Perhaps this helps to clarify that perimeters are very often
highly effective and reasonably well defined, and that without them we would
be in serious trouble.

I wonder what planet Chris Brady has been living on for the last few
decades?  Almost every "free trial offer" you get through the mail or by the
Web works by taking payment details, and then charging you at the end of the
trial unless you positively decline. Amazon is no different - and Googling
for "amazon prime free trial" takes you in a couple of clicks to Amazon's
help pages telling you how to decline at the end of your free trial. Most
likely this would also appear in an e-mail at the end of the trial, though I
don't know whether Amazon is obliged by law to do this.  As for the "payment
declined", I'd guess this actually just an authorization request to check
the card validity.
