Matthew Green, On the NSA, 5 Sep 2013
&lt;<a href="http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2013/09/on-nsa.html">http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2013/09/on-nsa.html</a>&gt;

Let me tell you the story of my tiny brush with the biggest crypto story of
the year.

A few weeks ago I received a call from a reporter atProPublica, asking me
background questions about encryption. Right off the bat I knew this was
going to be an odd conversation, since this gentleman seemed convinced that
the NSA had vast capabilities to defeat encryption. And not in a 'hey, d'ya
think the NSA has vast capabilities to defeat encryption?' kind of way. No,
he'd already established the defeating. We were just haggling over the
details.

Oddness aside it was a fun (if brief) set of conversations, mostly involving
hypotheticals. If the NSA could do this, how might they do it?  What would
the impact be? I admit that at this point one of my biggest concerns was to
avoid coming off like a crank. After all, if I got quoted sounding too much
like an NSA conspiracy nut, my colleagues would laugh at me. Then I might
not get invited to the cool security parties.

All of this is a long way of saying that I was totally unprepared for
today's bombshell revelations describing the NSA's efforts to defeat
encryption. Not only does the worst possible hypothetical I discussed appear
to be true, but it's true on a scale I couldn't even imagine. I'm no longer
the crank. I wasn't even close to cranky enough.

And since I never got a chance to see the documents that sourced the
NYT/ProPublica story—and I would give my right arm to see them—I'm
determined to make up for this deficit with sheer speculation. Which is
exactly what this blog post will be.

'Bullrun' and 'Cheesy Name'

If you haven't read the NYT or Guardian stories, you probably should. The
TL;DR is that the NSA has been doing some very bad things. At a combined
cost of $250 million per year, they include:

 * Tampering with national standards (NIST is specifically
   mentioned) to promote weak, or otherwise vulnerable cryptography.
 * Influencing standards committees to weaken protocols.
 * Working with hardware and software vendors to weaken encryption
   and random number generators.
 * Attacking the encryption used by 'the next generation of 4G
   phones'.
 * Obtaining cleartext access to 'a major Internet peer-to-peer
   voice and text communications system' (Skype?)
 * Identifying and cracking vulnerable keys.
 * Establishing a Human Intelligence division to infiltrate the
   global telecommunications industry.
 * And worst of all (to me): somehow decrypting SSL connections.

All of these programs go by different code names, but the NSA's decryption
program goes by the name 'Bullrun' so that's what I'll use here.

How to break a cryptographic system

There's almost too much here for a short blog post, so I'm going to start
with a few general thoughts. Readers of this blog should know that there
are basically three ways to break a cryptographic system. In no particular
order, they are:  [...]

Mike Masnick, TechDirt, from the now-take-a-look dept, 9 Sep 2013
&lt;<a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130909/11193024453/johns-hopkins-tells-security-researcher-to-remove-blog-post-about-nsa-encryption-attacks-university-server.shtml">http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130909/11193024453/johns-hopkins-tells-security-researcher-to-remove-blog-post-about-nsa-encryption-attacks-university-server.shtml</a>&gt;

Last week, a great blog post by cryptographer and research professor Matthew
Green was posted, providing some fantastic details about the likely attack
vectors by the NSA to compromise encryption schemes. It's a well written and
detailed piece from someone who clearly knows what he's talking about. Oh,
and it kicks off with an amusing story about how the reporters working on
the "NSA builds backdoors into encryption" story had contacted him for
comments and, because they didn't reveal too many details, he was concerned
about coming off as too paranoid or too much of a "crank." However, after
the details came out, he realized he "wasn't cranky enough."

Oddness aside it was a fun (if brief) set of conversations, mostly involving
hypotheticals. If the NSA could do this, how might they do it? What would
the impact be? I admit that at this point one of my biggest concerns was to
avoid coming off like a crank. After all, if I got quoted sounding too much
like an NSA conspiracy nut, my colleagues would laugh at me. Then I might
not get invited to the cool security parties.

All of this is a long way of saying that I was totally unprepared for
today's bombshell revelations describing the NSA's efforts to defeat
encryption. Not only does the worst possible hypothetical I discussed appear
to be true, but it's true on a scale I couldn't even imagine. I'm no longer
the crank. I wasn't even close to cranky enough.

He then goes on to explain where the most probable attacks are coming from
and what we should be most worried about and what's likely still safe. I had
hoped to write up something about the post in general, but today something
new came up. Green noted that the Dean where he teaches, at Johns Hopkins,
had asked him to remove the blog post from the university's servers. The
blog post was cross-posted both to a blog on the university's servers, as
well as to Green's personal blog on Blogger. The personal blog post is still
up (and now about to get that much more attention for the takedown). He also
notes that this "isn't my Dean's fault" though plenty of folks are curious
whose fault it might be. For what it's worth, it appears that Hopkins has a
close relationship with the NSA, and the school really isn't that far from
the NSA's headquarters. [...]

Nate Anderson, ArsTechnica, 9 Sep 2013
Predictable backtrack from Johns Hopkins comes a few hours later.
&lt;<a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/09/crypto-prof-asked-to-remove-nsa-related-blog-post/">http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/09/crypto-prof-asked-to-remove-nsa-related-blog-post/</a>&gt;

Matthew Green is a well-known cryptography professor, currently teaching in
the computer science department of Johns Hopkins University in
Baltimore. Last week, Green authored a long and interesting blog post about
the recent revelations that the National Security Agency (NSA) has, among
much else, subverted crypto standards. In his words, "The TL;DR ['too long;
didn't read' version] is that the NSA has been doing some very bad things."
And Green went on to speculate at some length about what those "bad things"
were and what they might mean.

Today, Green's academic dean contacted him to ask that "all copies" of the
blog post be removed from university servers. Green said that the move was
not "my Dean's fault," but he did not elaborate. Were cryptology professors
at Johns Hopkins not allowed to say, as Green had, things like:

I was totally unprepared for today's bombshell revelations describing the
NSA's efforts to defeat encryption. Not only does the worst possible
hypothetical I discussed appear to be true, but it's true on a scale I
couldn't even imagine. I'm no longer the crank. I wasn't even close to
cranky enough.

Was basic academic freedom on the line? Had the request even come initially
from Johns Hopkins or from outside the school—perhaps someone at the NSA
headquarters just up the road from Baltimore?

I asked John Hopkins, and spokesman Dennis O'Shea responded with the
school's side of the story:

The university received information this morning that Matthew Green's blog
contained a link or links to classified material and also used the NSA
logo. For that reason, we asked Professor Green to remove the Johns
Hopkins-hosted mirror site for his blog.

Upon further review, we note that the NSA logo has been removed and that he
appears to link to material that has been published in the news
media. Interim Dean Andrew Douglas will inform Professor Green that the
mirror site may be restored.

The statement raised further questions, including: from whom did the school
"receive" its information? Why was the school's top administration getting
involved in the use of the NSA logo on one professor's individual blog post?
What was the point of the request given that Green had also published the
post to a mirror hosted at Blogger? Wasn't the whole episode likely to bring
far greater traffic to Green's post once word of the takedown request got
out?

Late this afternoon, Green shared his side of the story on Twitter (tweets
concatenated below for ease of reading): [...]

<i>Wed, 11 Sep 2013 11:26:53 -0400</i><pre>
Nicole Perlroth, *The New York Times*, 10 Sep 2013, via ACM TechNews,

The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) announced
that it will reopen the public vetting process for the Dual EC DRBG
encryption standard, after reports that the U.S. National Security Agency
(NSA) had written the standard and could break it.  "We want to assure the
IT cybersecurity community that the transparent, public process used to
rigorously vet our standards is still in place," NIST says.  "NIST would not
deliberately weaken a cryptographic standard."  The announcement comes after
recent revelations that NSA has been able to get around much of the
encryption that protects massive amounts of information on the Internet.
For encryption to be secure, the system must generate secret prime numbers
randomly.  However, one of the random number generators used in the Dual EC
DRBG standard contained a back door for the NSA.  The standard was adopted
by NIST and by the International Organization for Standardization, which has
163 member countries.  Many cryptographers previously had expressed
reservations about NSA's participation in developing encryption standards,
and some say they now have lost confidence in the NIST standards-setting
process.  "We'll have to re-evaluate that relationship," Johns Hopkins
University cryptography researcher Matthew D. Green wrote in a blog
post. "Trust has been violated."

interests, U.S. officials said.  The practice isn't frequent—one official
estimated a handful of cases in the last decade—but it's common enough to
garner its own spycraft label: LOVEINT.

New details of the NSA's capabilities suggest encryption can still be

The so-called Internet of Things—digitally connected devices like
appliances, cars and medical equipment—promises to make life easier for
consumers. But regulators are worried that some products may be magnets for
hackers.

On Wednesday, the Federal Trade Commission took its first action to protect
consumers from reckless invasions of privacy, penalizing a company that
sells Web-enabled video cameras for lax security practices.

According to the F.T.C., the company, TRENDnet, told customers that its
products were `secure', marketing its cameras for home security and baby
monitoring. In fact, the devices were compromised. The commission said a
hacker in January 2012 exploited a security flaw and posted links to the
live feeds, which “displayed babies asleep in their cribs, young children
playing and adults going about their daily lives.''

Stroll among the games at the Cosmopolitan, the newest casino on the Las
Vegas Strip, and you might be overwhelmed by the latest whooping and
flashing gambling machines. All the high-resolution monitors and video
effects, devoted to themes ranging from deep-sea-fishing expeditions to
Spider-Man to the unsubtlest visions of cash washing over lucky winners, are
only the most obvious signs of technology's move onto the casino
floor. Behind the scenes, server-based gaming now enables managers to
rapidly alter payouts, raise or reduce betting minimums, even change games
themselves. (In just minutes, a bank of slot machines styled for dance
clubbers can be rethemed to appeal to church ladies on a Sunday afternoon.)
But a few deceptively prim-looking machines represent an even greater
technological leap, the biggest advance in automated gambling since Charles
Fey introduced the one-armed bandit in 1895. They owe the way they play to
artificial intelligence.

The machines, called Texas Hold 'Em Heads Up Poker, play the limit version
of the popular game so well that they can be counted on to beat
poker-playing customers of most any skill level. Gamblers might win a given
hand out of sheer luck, but over an extended period, as the impact of luck
evens out, they must overcome carefully trained neural nets that
self-learned to play aggressively and unpredictably with the expertise of a
skilled professional. Later this month, a new souped-up version of the game,
endorsed by Phil Hellmuth, who has won more World Series of Poker
tournaments than anyone, will have its debut at the Global Gaming Expo in
Las Vegas. The machines will then be rolled out into casinos around the
world.

They will be placed alongside the pure numbers-crunchers, indifferent to the
gambler. But poker is a game of skill and intuition, of bluffs and
traps. The familiar adage is that in poker, you play the player, not the
cards. This machine does that, responding to opponents' moves and pursuing
optimal strategies. But to compete at the highest levels and beat the best
human players, the approach must be impeccable.  Gregg Giuffria, whose
company, G2 Game Design, developed Texas Hold 'Em Heads Up Poker, was
testing a prototype of the program in his Las Vegas office when he thought
he detected a flaw. When he played passively until a hand's very last card
was dealt and then suddenly made a bet, the program folded rather than match
his bet and risk losing more money. "I called in all my employees and told
them that there's a problem," he says. The software seemed to play in an
easily exploitable pattern. "Then I played 200 more hands, and he never did
anything like that again. That was the point when we nicknamed him Little
Bastard." ...

I wouldn't normally pay much attention to an item like this, but there's
just something about it that I find fascinating, involving Amazon's Kindle
and Legos.  A university professor in Austria has released the video below,
showing how he has automated a low-tech approach to bypassing the digital
rights management system on the Kindle.  His name is Peter Purgathofer, and
he's an associate professor at the Vienna University of Technology.

Using Lego's Mindstorms - a basic robotics kit popular with hobbyists - plus
a Kindle and a Mac, he has assembled a way to photograph what's on the
screen, and then submit it to a cloud-based text-recognition service.  It's
sort of a combination of high tech meets low. The scanning is done by way of
the Mac's iSight camera. The Mindstorms set does two things: Hits the
page-advance button on the Kindle (it appears to be an older model, like the
one in the picture above), then mashes the space bar on the Mac, causing it
to take a picture. ...

the city could gain up to $29 million by installing new cameras."

&gt; Facebook, Twitter and Google have been caught snooping on messages sent
&gt; across their networks, new research claims, prompting campaigners to express
&gt; concerns over privacy.

I'm not sure there is actual snooping going on here.  One way to protect
naive users against phishing attacks is to open the URLs they have been sent
and examine them for "phishiness".  Bad URLs are rewritten.

If that's what's going on here and no records are kept, then it's probably
no great cause for concern (although the practice should be clearly
disclosed and customers should be given the chance to opt out).  But if
records are kept (and some techniques at least require records of the URLs
that appear, though not association with particular customers) or if the
URLs are used for other purposes such as advertising or warrantless
searches, then I see a bigger problem.

&gt; former intelligence official told NBC, "This is why you don't hire
&gt; brilliant people for jobs like this. You hire smart people. Brilliant
&gt; people get you in trouble.''

If by "brilliant" he means "eccentric", the main trouble may be
embarrassment.  The real danger is not from brilliant people publicizing
secrets for ideological reasons, but from ordinary people who may sell them
to foreign agents or criminals.

It's not just the NSA—access to sensitive information in banks, medical
institutions, etc., is often protected by third-party security products.
It's easy to imagine that a developer of such a product, under financial
pressure, may be tempted to install a back door in the product and sell
access to the highest bidder.  Of course we would never hear of such cases
(which in all likelihood may have already happened) because even a rumor
that something like this is possible might bring down a security company --
and many of its customers.

There's been more details on the London building that acts as a lens

<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/sep/06/walkie-talkie-architect-predicted-reflection-sun-rays">http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/sep/06/walkie-talkie-architect-predicted-reflection-sun-rays</a>

1. "the original design of the building had featured horizontal sun louvres
on its south-facing facade , but these are believed to have been removed
during cost-cutting as the project developed."

2. "The developers have blamed the problem on "the current elevation of the
sun in the sky," a position Vinoly [n~] seems inclined to share."

It sounds more like the developers used a weather dataset from the last two
summers, so assumed that sunlight would not be an observable event during
most of the month -so cut back on preventative actions. Happily for most UK
residents, and sadly for the building developers, August has been very
sunny.  If so, blame weather datasets and cost/benefit spreadsheets, not CAD
tools.
