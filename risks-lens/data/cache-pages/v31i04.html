<i>Mon, 21 Jan 2019 09:54:06 -0800</i><pre>
The network must be secure enough for the innovations it promises.
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/21/opinion/5g-cybersecurity-china.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/21/opinion/5g-cybersecurity-china.html</a>

  While I'm not so wild about some of Wheeler's detailed recommendations,
  he's correct that security should be a paramount goal for 5G.

Some quotes from this article and referenced reports:

"When 5G enables autonomous vehicles, do we want those cars and trucks
crashing into each other because the Russians hacked the network?"

"If 5G will be the backbone of breakthroughs such as remote surgery, should
that network be vulnerable to the North Koreans breaking into a surgical
procedure?"

"Make the Internet safe and secure for the functioning of Government and
critical services for the American people."

"5G Communications and other next generation networks designed and
architected at the outset with enhanced security, connectivity, and
availability."

"Decades of well-intentioned but disjointed activities have made the
Internet progressively less safe for the critical services which depend upon
it."

"Embrace a 'secure to market' over a 'first to market' mentality"

"Unfortunately, relying on market forces alone fails to adequately
weigh the risks imposed on third parties who rely on the networks and
services they provision."

"Problems known as 'market failures' can discourage investment and
contribute to the insecurity of the critical communications network."

"Because of negative externalities (third parties affected by insecure IoT),
the private sector may not have sufficient incentives to invest in
cybersecurity beyond their own corporate interests."

"5G will enable a massive expansion of IoT endpoints that lack the
processing power and memory needed for robust security protections.
Fortunately, 5G is at an early phase in its development and, if security is
designed in, it may be able to mitigate the cyber risk from these IoT
endpoints."

"Firms make decisions that strike a balance between the costs and benefits
of cybersecurity investments for themselves.  But they do not consider the
additional benefit to the public at large of investing in cybersecurity.
The result is a gap in cybersecurity preparedness that the market, on its
own, is unlikely to fill."

"The attack surface offered by the IoT is growing rapidly, calling for
concerted effort to improve security.  Multiple network providers are
impacted by the IoT, rendering a consistent response difficult.  In
addition, the multiplicity of price-competitive vendors hinders concerted
efforts to build in voluntary security by design into the IoT."

More:

The Trump administration's so-called "race" with China to build new
fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks is speeding toward a network
vulnerable to Chinese (and other) cyberattacks. ... We cannot allow the hype
about 5G to overshadow the absolute necessity that it be secure.  [...]

Leadership in 5G technology is not just about building a network, but also
about whether that network will be secure enough for the innovations it
promises.  And the 5G "race" is more complex and dangerous than industry and
the Trump administration portray.  When 5G enables autonomous vehicles, do
we want those cars and trucks crashing into each other because the Russians
hacked the network?  If 5G will be the backbone of breakthroughs such as
remote surgery, should that network be vulnerable to the North Koreans
breaking into a surgical procedure? ...  Nowhere in the president's
directive, for instance, was there a word about protecting the cybersecurity
of the new network.

As the President's National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee
told him in November, "the cybersecurity threat now poses an existential
threat to the future of the Nation."  Last January, the brightest technical
minds in the intelligence community, working with the White House National
Security Council (NSC), warned of the 5G cybersecurity threat. ...

<a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/DRAFT">https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/DRAFT</a> NSTAC_ReportToThePresidentOnACybersecurityMoonshot_508c.pdf

...  Shortly after taking office, the Trump FCC removed a requirement
imposed by the Obama FCC that the 5G technical standard must be designed
from the outset to withstand cyberattacks.  For the first time in history,
cybersecurity was being required as a forethought in the design of a new
network standard—until the Trump FCC repealed it.  The Trump FCC also
canceled a formal inquiry seeking input from the country's best technical
minds about 5G security, retracted an Obama-era FCC white paper about
reducing cyberthreats, and questioned whether the agency had any
responsibility for the cybersecurity of the networks they are entrusted with
overseeing.

<a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-343096A1.pdf">https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-343096A1.pdf</a>

The simple fact is that our wireless networks are not as secure as they
could be because they weren't designed to withstand the kinds of
cyberattacks that are now common. ...

<i>Sat, 26 Jan 2019 15:09:28 -0500</i><pre>
<a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/01/24/computer-supply-chain-attacks/">https://theintercept.com/2019/01/24/computer-supply-chain-attacks/</a>

&gt;From the article:

In October, Bloomberg Businessweek published an alarming story: Operatives
working for China's People's Liberation Army had secretly implanted
microchips into motherboards made in China and sold by U.S.-based
Supermicro. This allegedly gave Chinese spies clandestine access to servers
belonging to over 30 American companies, including Apple, Amazon, and
various government suppliers, in an operation known as a "supply chain
attack," in which malicious hardware or software is inserted into products
before they are shipped to surveillance targets.

[...] But while Bloomberg's story may well be completely (or partly) wrong,
the danger of China compromising hardware supply chains is very real,
judging from classified intelligence documents. U.S. spy agencies were
warned about the threat in stark terms nearly a decade ago and even assessed
that China was adept at corrupting the software bundled closest to a
computer's hardware at the factory, threatening some of the U.S.
government's most sensitive machines, according to documents provided by
National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden. The documents also
detail how the U.S. and its allies have themselves systematically targeted
and subverted tech supply chains, with the NSA conducting its own such
operations, including in China, in partnership with the CIA and other
intelligence agencies. The documents also disclose supply chain operations
by German and French intelligence.

Currently automakers say they get customer permission before they use the
individual data they collect for marketing or share it with third
parties. Volvo said in a statement that its technology “takes full account
of legal, security, and privacy obligations on a global scale'' and complies
with a European Union law that lets residents control how their personal
data is shared.

An Amazon spokesman says that the company merely shares “anonymized,
aggregated performance data to help automakers improve the customer
experience'' and that it doesn't provide personally identifiable information
to car companies or developers.

BMW shares the data it collects but says it doesn't make money from it
directly. "Let's say the person is listening to certain music, and we know
there's a big concert," says Dieter May, senior vice president of digital
products for BMW. "Then we would probably give that to our salespeople to
make an offer for a special ticket."

But even as governments and corporations begin to address security
questions, it's unclear who will control the data that is collected.

*This year's World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where business
leaders' public positions on automation's impact on workers did not match
the views they shared privately.*

EXCERPT:

They'll never admit it in public, but many of your bosses want machines to
replace you as soon as possible.

I know this because, for the past week, I've been mingling with corporate
executives at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos. And I've
noticed that their answers to questions about automation depend very much
on who is listening.

In public, many executives wring their hands over the negative consequences
that artificial intelligence and automation could have for workers. They
take part in panel discussions about building `human-centered AI' for the
“Fourth Industrial Revolution''—Davos-speak for the corporate adoption
of machine learning and other advanced technology—and talk about the need
to provide a safety net for people who lose their jobs as a result of
automation.

But in private settings, including meetings with the leaders of the many
consulting and technology firms whose pop-up storefronts line the Davos
Promenade, these executives tell a different story: They are racing to
automate their own work forces to stay ahead of the competition, with
little regard for the impact on workers.

All over the world, executives are spending billions of dollars to
transform their businesses into lean, digitized, highly automated
operations. They crave the fat profit margins automation can deliver, and
they see AI as a golden ticket to savings, perhaps by letting them
whittle departments with thousands of workers down to just a few dozen.

“People are looking to achieve very big numbers,'' said Mohit Joshi, the
president of Infosys, a technology and consulting firm that helps other
businesses automate their operations. “Earlier they had incremental, 5 to
10 percent goals in reducing their work force.  Now they're saying, `Why
can't we do it with 1 percent of the people we have?' ''

Few American executives will admit wanting to get rid of human workers, a
taboo in today's age of inequality. So they've come up with a long list of
buzzwords and euphemisms to disguise their intent. Workers aren't being
replaced by machines, they're being `released' from onerous, repetitive
tasks.  Companies aren't laying off workers, they're “undergoing digital
transformation.''

A 2017 survey by Deloitte found that 53 percent of companies had already
started to use machines to perform tasks previously done by humans. The
figure is expected to climb to 72 percent by next year.

The corporate elite's AI obsession has been lucrative for firms that
specialize in `robotic process automation', or RPA.  Infosys, which is based
in India, reported a 33 percent increase in year-over-year revenue in its
digital division. IBM's “cognitive solutions'' unit, which uses AI to help
businesses increase efficiency, has become the company's second-largest
division, posting $5.5 billion in revenue last quarter. The investment bank
UBS projects that the artificial intelligence industry could be worth as
much as $180 billion by next year.

Kai-Fu Lee, the author of `AI Superpowers' and a longtime technology
executive, predicts that artificial intelligence will eliminate 40 percent
of the world's jobs within 15 years. In an interview, he said that chief
executives were under enormous pressure from shareholders and boards to
maximize short-term profits, and that the rapid shift toward automation was
the inevitable result.

The Milwaukee offices of the Taiwanese electronics maker Foxconn, whose
chairman has said he plans to replace 80 percent of the company's workers
with robots in five to 10 years.

“They always say it's more than the stock price, But in the end, if you
screw up, you get fired.''

Other experts have predicted that AI will create more new jobs than it
destroys, and that job losses caused by automation will probably not be
catastrophic. They point out that some automation helps workers by improving
productivity and freeing them to focus on creative tasks over routine ones.

But at a time of political unrest and anti-elite movements on the
progressive left and the nationalist right, it's probably not surprising
that all of this automation is happening quietly, out of public view. In
Davos this week, several executives declined to say how much money they had
saved by automating jobs previously done by humans. And none were willing
to say publicly that replacing human workers is their ultimate goal.

“That's the great dichotomy,'' said Ben Pring, the director of the Center
for the Future of Work at Cognizant, a technology services firm. “On one
hand,'' he said, profit-minded executives “absolutely want to automate as
much as they can.  On the other hand, they're facing a backlash in civic
society.''

For an unvarnished view of how some American leaders talk about automation
in private, you have to listen to their counterparts in Asia, who often make
no attempt to hide their aims. Terry Gou, the chairman of the Taiwanese
electronics manufacturer Foxconn, has said the company plans to replace 80
percent of its workers with robots in the next five to 10 years.  Richard
Liu, the founder of the Chinese e-commerce company JD.com, said at a
business conference last year that “I hope my company would be 100 percent
automation someday.''

One common argument made by executives is that workers whose jobs are
eliminated by automation can be `reskilled' to perform other jobs in an
organization. They offer examples like Accenture, which claimed in 2017 to
have replaced 17,000 back-office processing jobs without layoffs, by
training employees to work elsewhere in the company. In a letter to
shareholders last year, Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive, said that more
than 16,000 Amazon warehouse workers had received training in high-demand
fields like nursing and aircraft mechanics, with the company covering 95
percent of their expenses. [...]

&gt;From the article:

Ahead of national elections in April and May, India's political parties are
pouring money into creating hundreds of thousands of WhatsApp group chats to
spread political messages and memes. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has drawn up plans to have three WhatsApp
groups for each of India's 927,533 polling booths, according to
reports. With each group containing a maximum of 256 members, that number of
group chats could theoretically reach more than 700 million people out of
India's population of 1.3 billion.

[...] [A]ccording to researchers, as well as screenshots of group chats from
as recently as January seen by TIME, these WhatsApp group chats frequently
contain and disseminate false information and hateful rhetoric, much of
which comes from forwarded messages. Experts say the Hindu nationalist BJP
is fueling this trend, although opposition parties are using the same
tactics.

Abstract

The duty to read doctrine is a well-recognized building block of U.S.
contract law.  Under this doctrine, contracting parties are held responsible
for the written terms of their contract, whether or not they actually read
them. The application of duty to read is especially interesting in the
context of consumer contracts, which consumers generally do not read.

Under U.S. law, courts routinely impose this doctrine on consumers. However,
the application of this doctrine to consumer contracts is one-sided. While
consumers are excepted to read their contracts, suppliers are generally not
required to offer readable contracts. This asymmetry creates a serious
public policy challenge. Put simply, consumers might be expected to read
contracts that are, in fact, rather unreadable. This, in turn, undermines
market efficiency and raises fairness concerns.

Numerous scholars have suggested that consumer contracts are indeed written
in a way that dissuades consumers from reading them. This Article aims to
empirically test whether this concern is justified. The Article focuses on
the readability of an important and prevalent type of consumer agreements:
the sign-in-wrap contract. Such contracts, which have already been the focal
point of many legal battles, are routinely accepted by consumers when
signing up for popular websites such as Facebook, Amazon, Uber, and Airbnb.

The Article applies well-established linguistic readability tests to the 500
most popular websites in the U.S. that use sign-in-wrap agreements. We find,
among other things, that effectively reading these agreements requires, on
average, more than 14.5 years of education. This result is troubling, given
that the majority of U.S. adults read at an 8th-grade level. These empirical
findings hence have significant implications for the design of consumer
contract law.

If you see a video of a politician speaking words he never would utter, or a
Hollywood star improbably appearing in a cheap adult movie, don't adjust
your television set—you may just be witnessing the future of "fake news."
"Deepfake" videos that manipulate reality are becoming more sophisticated
due to advances in artificial intelligence, creating the potential for new

EXCERPTS:

If you see a video of a politician speaking words he never would utter, or
a Hollywood star improbably appearing in a cheap adult movie, don't adjust
your television set—you may just be witnessing the future of "fake news."

"Deepfake" videos that manipulate reality are becoming more sophisticated
due to advances in artificial intelligence, creating the potential for new
kinds of misinformation with devastating consequences.  As the technology
advances, worries are growing about how deepfakes can be used for nefarious
purposes by hackers or state actors.

"We're not quite to the stage where we are seeing deepfakes weaponized, but
that moment is coming," Robert Chesney, a University of Texas law professor
who has researched the topic, told AFP.  Chesney argues that deepfakes could
add to the current turmoil over disinformation and influence operations.  "A
well-timed and thoughtfully scripted deepfake or series of deepfakes could
tip an election, spark violence in a city primed for civil unrest, bolster
insurgent narratives about an enemy's supposed atrocities, or exacerbate
political divisions in a society," Chesney and University of Maryland
professor Danielle Citron said in a blog post for the Council on Foreign
Relations.

Digital manipulation may be good for Hollywood but new "deepfake" techniques
could create a new kind of misinformation, according to researchers.  Paul
Scharre, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, a think
tank specializing in AI and security issues, said it was almost inevitable
that deepfakes would be used in upcoming elections.

A fake video could be deployed to smear a candidate, Scharre said, or to
enable people to deny actual events captured on authentic video.
With believable fake videos in circulation, he added, "people can choose to
believe whatever version or narrative that they want, and that's a real
concern." [...]

The story doesn't end here, because Hal said he never had an eBay

*Ran malware on own phones as test, uploading all their WhatsApp messages,
other data.*

At the Shmoocon security conference here on January 19, two researchers from
the mobile security provider Lookout revealed the first details of a mobile
surveillance effort run by a yet-to-be-named state intelligence agency that
they had discovered by exploring the command-and-control infrastructure
behind a novel piece of mobile malware.

In the process of exploring the malware's infrastructure, Lookout
researchers found iOS, Android, and Windows versions of the malware, as well
as data uploaded from a targeted phone's WhatsApp data. That phone turned
out to be one that belonged to one of the state-backed surveillance efforts
-- and the WhatsApp messages and other data found on the server provided a
nearly full contact list for the actors and details of their interactions
with commercial hacking companies and eventual decision to build their own
malware.  [...]

It's easier to RF hack an industrial crane than to hack a garage door
opener.  $40-60 of RF parts gives you control.

Recommendation: off-the-shelf open source protocols rather than proprietary
roll-your-own "security through obscurity" protocols.  But you already knew
that.

Here are some selected paragraphs from a recent report.

<a href="https://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/white_papers/wp-a-security-analysis-of-radio-remote-controllers.pdf">https://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/white_papers/wp-a-security-analysis-of-radio-remote-controllers.pdf</a>

A Security Analysis of Radio Remote Controllers for Industrial Applications

Our research shows that there is a discrepancy between the consumer and
industrial worlds.  In the consumer world, the perceived risks have pushed
the vendors to find reasonably secure, albeit imperfect, solutions such as
rolling codes.  In the industrial world, where the assets at risk are much
more valuable than a fancy house or car, there seems to be less awareness.

By exploiting various vulnerabilities that we discovered, we were able to
move full-sized cranes deployed in production at construction sites,
factories, and transportation businesses.  In all of the cases, we were able
to confirm and run the attacks very quickly.  In each of the cases, we were
able to switch on the controlled industrial machine even after the operator
had issued an e-stop, which put the machine in a "stop" state.

Apart from leaked schematics, the only available "technical" documentation
is limited to user manuals, and we are unaware of any public research about
the digital security risks in this space.  We hope that our findings will
inspire the RF- and hardware-hacking communities to continue looking at
these protocols, and to encourage vendors to focus on open, standard RF
protocols.

In conclusion, given that the kind of machinery these remote controllers are
managing can be dangerous if hijacked or disabled, manufacturers need to
start thinking about moving to stronger open-source protocols rather than
relying on security through obscurity.  It could be challenging to balance
the almost real-time requirements and secure RF transmission, but the
hardware technology is there, ready to be used.

*With Rapid DNA machines, genetic fingerprinting could become as routine as
the old-fashioned kind. But forensic experts see a potential for misuse.*

... many legal experts and scientists are troubled by the way the technology
is being used. As police agencies build out their local DNA databases, they
are collecting DNA not only from people who have been charged with major
crimes but also, increasingly, from people who are merely deemed suspicious,
permanently linking their genetic identities to criminal databases. [...]

If the Rapid DNA system has flaws, now is the moment to address them, many
experts argue. Peter Stout, president of the Houston Forensic Science
Center, was left with concerns after completing a Rapid DNA pilot program
with the Houston Police Department last February.  “We need fast and cheap.
It also needs to be right.''

RISKS readers are familiar with Facebook's Orwellian "real names" policy I
didn't realise how poor the implementation is. I only discovered when my
daughter wanted to sign up that it's so bad that many people will be forced
to sign up with a fake name to get around it.

When my daughter wanted to sign up Facebook decided that it didn't like her
name. The help pages are pretty useless and their is no real indication of
why. You have to guess why the name is rejected, but the solution appears to
be to go through the name verification process. The "clever" bit is that
there seems to be no way to start the name verification process until you
create an account, so you have to make up a name that it will accept and use
that to create the account.

At this point I'm guessing that a lot of people don't bother to verify their
real name and continue with the fake name. I can think of at least 2 of my
Facebook friends using names that aren't "the name they go by in everyday
life" (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/112146705538576">https://www.facebook.com/help/112146705538576</a>) good guess that it's
either not worth the effort of verifying their real name, or because their
official documents use a different form of their name to the one they
normally use in real life.

As currently implemented the policy seems to prevent you signing up with an
unusual name, but pretty much anybody can sign up as Paul Smith with no
checks.

Coffee or other drink, for example a caffeine containing drink, is delivered
to individuals that would like the drink, or who have a predetermined
cognitive state, using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)/drone. The drink is
connected to the UAV, and the UAV flies to an area including people, and
uses sensors to scan the people for an individual who has gestured that they
would like the drink, or for whom an electronic analysis of sensor data
indicates to be in a predetermined cognitive state. The UAV then flies to
the individual to deliver the drink. The analysis can include profile data
of people, including electronic calendar data, which can be used to
determine a potentially predetermined cognitive state.

Hebei court unveils program to expose deadbeat debtors
Zhang Yu in Shijiazhuang, chinadaily.com.cn,  16 Jan 2019:

Deadbeat debtors in North China's Hebei province will find it more difficult
to abscond as the Higher People's Court of Hebei on Monday introduced a
mini-program on WeChat targeting them.

Called "a map of deadbeat debtors", the program allows users to find out
whether there are any debtors within 500 meters.

The debtor's information is available to check in the program, making it
easier for people to whistle-blow on debtors capable of paying their debts.

"It's a part of our measures to enforce our rulings and create a socially
credible environment," said a spokesman of the court.

Will the Covington Catholic High School fiasco change social media?

Thank Apple for removing the jack from their iPhones.

I carry around a lot of &lt;$5 earbuds for my own use on airplanes &amp; my digital
audio player, so I'm happy to donate them to someone to listen privately.

Cheap headphones for modern USB and Bluetooth never materialized, so I'm not
about to carry around $100 earbuds to donate.
