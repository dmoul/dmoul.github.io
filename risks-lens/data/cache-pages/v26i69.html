The long-awaited report on the deadly 23 Jul 2011 high-speed train crash in
Wenzhou CHINA attributes it to a string of blunders, including serious
design flaws in crucial equipment used to signal and control the trains that
was purchased, evaluated, and used improperly.  Two top former officials of
the Railway Ministry were singled out for blame.  Public outrage died down
only after government authorities muzzled the domestic media.  The intense
public reaction to the accident and the bungled rescue effort that followed
are considered major reasons why the Chinese government is now instituting
tighter controls of Internet message boards known as microblogs [and
presumably the censorship of this issue of RISKS?].  However, the report
is lacking in details on what actually went wrong technically—although
it mentions failure to notice failure to notice that lightning strikes had
affected the equipment.  The *NYT* article is well worth reading in full.

I recently ran across Richard Feynman's appendix to the Rogers Commission
Report on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident (published June 6, 1986),
and one passage (quoted below) about the software in the space shuttle
struck me. He describes what it takes to check and test for the correctness
and reliability of the software. (NASA does not even attempt to deal with
the software's security against attackers, presumably because it was judged
that software in a closed system like the shuttle is not very vulnerable.)

I suggest reading this with voting system software in mind. Notice in the
3rd paragraph his point about management's temptation to curtail the amount
of checking and testing even in the face of "perpetual" requests for
software changes, and the need to resist that temptation. The shuttle's
software was at that time about 250,000 lines of code—on the same order
as that in a voting system (e.g. a DRE).20

Quoted from <a href="http://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v2appf.htm">http://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v2appf.htm</a>

  Because of the enormous effort required to replace the software for such
  an elaborate system, and for checking a new system out, no change has been
  made to the hardware since the system began about fifteen years ago.  The
  actual hardware is obsolete; for example, the memories are of the old
  ferrite core type. It is becoming more difficult to find manufacturers to
  supply such old-fashioned computers reliably and of high quality. Modern
  computers are very much more reliable, can run much faster, simplifying
  circuits, and allowing more to be done, and would not require so much
  loading of memory, for the memories are much larger.

The software is checked very carefully in a bottom-up fashion. First, each
new line of code is checked, then sections of code or modules with special
functions are verified. The scope is increased step by step until the new
changes are incorporated into a complete system and checked. This complete
output is considered the final product, newly released. But completely
independently there is an independent verification group, that takes an
adversary attitude to the software development group, and tests and verifies
the software as if it were a customer of the delivered product. There is
additional verification in using the new programs in simulators, etc. A
discovery of an error during verification testing is considered very
serious, and its origin studied very carefully to avoid such mistakes in the
future. Such unexpected errors have been found only about six times in all
the programming and program changing (for new or altered payloads) that has
been done. The principle that is followed is that all the verification is
not an aspect of program safety, it is merely a test of that safety, in a
non-catastrophic verification. Flight safety is to be judged solely on how
well the programs do in the verification tests. A failure here generates
considerable concern.

To summarize then, the computer software checking system and attitude is of
the highest quality. There appears to be no process of gradually fooling
oneself while degrading standards so characteristic of the Solid Rocket
Booster or Space Shuttle Main Engine safety systems. To be sure, there have
been recent suggestions by management to curtail such elaborate and
expensive tests as being unnecessary at this late date in Shuttle
history. This must be resisted for it does not appreciate the mutual subtle
influences, and sources of error generated by even small changes of one part
of a program on another. There are perpetual requests for changes as new
payloads and new demands and modifications are suggested by the
users. Changes are expensive because they require extensive testing. The
proper way to save money is to curtail the number of requested changes, not
the quality of testing for each.

I just listened to a very interesting 15-minute podcast discussion of risk
in aviation control systems.  The bottom line is that in some cases, the
control systems make mistakes and people (pilots) correct for them, but it's
actually more frequent for people to make mistakes because they don't
understand what's going on.  The interviewee argues that perhaps we should
trust software and recognize that it *will* make mistakes that will kill
some people, but fewer than would die without the software.  The podcast
concludes with an explanation that 100 years ago, one of the railroads
advertised that due to technological advancements only one person was being
killed each day in train accidents, rather than 10 per day as had been the
case!

Podcast is at <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/podcast/aerospace/aviation/the-benefits-of-risk/">http://spectrum.ieee.org/podcast/aerospace/aviation/the-benefits-of-risk/</a>

I am NOT arguing that voting is the same, and it's important to recognize
that they're talking about reliability (not security) - the key difference
being that in reliability you're concerned about ACCIDENTAL errors causing
failures, while in security you're concerned with INTENTIONAL errors causing
failures.  Also, the failure calculations assume a static environment, but
with constant software changes and constant changes to the systems that the
software is part of it's anything but a static environment.

But thinking of a voting system as a compete system - including the people,
equipment, processes, etc. - it's interesting to consider how the accidental
failure rate compares for an electronic system to a traditional system.
Said another way, consider three cases:

(1) The current environment, comparing an optical scan system to a DRE-based
system, recognizing the risks of accidental bugs in the DRE software
vs. accidental loss of optical scan ballots, accidental misprogramming of
both, accidental loss or erasure of memory cards, etc.

(2) Comparing the current environment (with either optical scan or DRE) to
an Internet voting environment, IGNORING all security concerns for the
Internet environment - potentially reducing the risks of accidental errors
by pollworkers or election officials (but ignoring intentional insider
attacks by either pollworkers or election officials).

(3) Comparing the current environment to an Internet voting environment,
again ignoring security concerns for the Internet environment, but this time
including intentional insider attacks by pollworkers and election officials.

Of course quantifying any of these is very hard, but we know the risk is
non-zero for all of the failure cases.

I don't have any answers, but wonder if eliciting the questions might help
the public (and policymakers) understand the tradeoffs somewhat better, and
help answer the question "if I can bank online and shop online, why can't I
vote online", but also "if we can rely on software to fly our planes, why
can't we rely on software to run our elections".

The New York Times said it accidentally sent e-mails on Wednesday to more
than eight million people who had shared their information with the company,
erroneously informing them they had canceled home delivery of the newspaper.
The Times Company, which initially mischaracterized the mishap as spam,
apologized for sending the e-mails. The 8.6 million readers who received the
e-mails represent a wide cross-section of readers who had given their
e-mails to the newspaper in the past, said a Times Company spokeswoman,
Eileen Murphy. ...  [Source: Amy Chozick, *The New York Times*, Media

Newark, NJ - Not quite the "War Of The Worlds" broadcast of a Martian
invasion in New Jersey, a Verizon "emergency" alert Monday that the company
texted to its wireless customers still jangled some nerves and triggered
hundreds of calls from concerned residents to local and state offices.  The
company sent the alert to customers in Middlesex, Monmouth and Ocean
counties, warning of a "civil emergency" and telling people to "take shelter
now." Trouble was, the message was meant to be a test but it wasn't labeled
as such, Verizon later admitted.  [AP item]

This article discusses testing for colour-blindness, but the first paragraph
deals with a risk sneaking through the cracks:

  In July 2002, a FedEx Boeing 727 carrying cargo crashed on its approach
  for a night-time landing in Tallahassee, Fl. A U.S. National
  Transportation Safety Board investigation identified the first officer's
  colour vision deficiency as a factor in the crash and recommended that all
  existing colour vision testing protocols employed by the U.S. Federal
  Aviation Administration (FAA) be reviewed. Four years later, this case,
  and the issues which it raised about colour blindness testing in the
  commercial aviation industry, was the subject of a panel at an
  international workshop hosted by Saudi Arabian Airlines.

           IMDb and Amazon vs. the "Ageless Actress" [NNSquad]
               <a href="http://lauren.vortex.com/archive/000916.html">http://lauren.vortex.com/archive/000916.html</a>

The story of a lawsuit relating to IMDb (part of Amazon.com) "outing"
the age of an actress (the plaintiff in this case, who wanted to keep
that information private) has been bouncing around for a bit now, but
recent developments are starting to suggest that Amazon has now
"jumped the shark" toward the dark side of this controversy.

While many observers have made light of this (so far anonymous)
actress' concerns (after all, your age isn't "protected" data in most
circumstances, and it's normally impossible to "unring" a bell in data
disclosure situations), the details of this case are actually quite
intriguing.

A core issue—and what should be a point of primary focus—is how
IMDb obtained the actress' age data before publishing it publicly.
The actress asserts (and Amazon appears to confirm) that this data was
obtained from the sign-up form the actress used to gain access to
(fee-based) IMDbPro services.

She claims that her age was requested as part of the routine sign-up
sequence along with credit card, address, and other related data, and
that it was not made clear that IMDb claimed the right to then use
this information in their public database.  When she asked them to
remove this data from public view, IMDb reportedly declined.

Digging through the rather voluminous IMDb user agreements and privacy
policy documents as they exist today at least, it's difficult for me
to determine whether IMDb's data usage policy in this respect was
definitively spelled out or not.

My own view is that there should always be an extremely clear
demarcation between personal information used to sign up for a
service, vs. the information that will be used by the service beyond
the purposes of signing up (e.g., posting in their publicly accessible
database).  Such a notice should not just be buried in policies on
other pages either—it should be right up front on the sign-up page,
as in "Please note that your age information as entered on this form
will become part of your publicly viewable profile on IMDb."

The plaintiff in the case under discussion asserts that no such notice
was clearly provided.  Obviously this will be an issue for the court
to determine, both in terms of the type of notice (if any) provided,
and whether Amazon's use of the provided data was in keeping with
their legal obligations under their Terms of Service and in all other
relevant aspects.

But now this case has taken a rather creepy turn, with Amazon loudly
proclaiming to the court that not only should the actress not be concerned
about her age being revealed, but that she shouldn't be able to remain
anonymous during the case. (<a href="http://j.mp/un92Fj">http://j.mp/un92Fj</a> [Hollywood Reporter])

For me at least, these assertions leave a bad taste, indeed.

Reasonable persons can argue about whether an actor, actress, or anyone else
should be concerned about their age being publicly known (age discrimination
is a fact of life both inside and outside of Hollywood).  But for Amazon to
take the "it's not a big deal" stance when they specifically are accused of
being the entity that publicly published data that had previously apparently
been carefully kept private, seems highly disingenuous at best.

Where Amazon really joins with Vader and company is their push to have the
actress' name (which they obviously already know) be publicly revealed.
Their motive seems clear—essentially, revenge.  If her identity is
exposed now, Amazon would have created a fait accompli that would serve no
purpose other than to create further distress on the part of the plaintiff.

Since public linkage of identity and age are at the center of this case,
there is no convincing reason I can see why this actress' identity should be
revealed at this stage.  We constantly condemn firms that inappropriately
attempt to unmask whistleblowers in court.  As far as I'm concerned, the
plaintiff in this case falls into the same "protected identity" status as
those whistleblowers, at this time.

Ultimately, the case should revolve around a single set of issues—did
Amazon/IMDb inappropriately use personal information for their public
database?  Were their Terms of Service clear regarding their use of IMDbPro
signup data?  Did the signup forms appropriately and clearly warn potential
subscribers how that signup data would be used by Amazon?

If IMDb was honest and clear on these points, with obvious notices on the
forms to warn users how submitted data could become public, then Amazon
should win this case.  If IMDb misused the signup data, or did not in a
clear and direct way warn users how signup information could go public, then
Amazon should lose.

The rest of Amazon's arguments regarding the case at this point appear to be
largely irrelevant and diversionary, and I hope that the court seems through
them, and concentrates on the question of Amazon's handling of personal
information and related notification disclosures.

So far, Amazon seems to be largely "blowing off" concerns about their
behavior in this matter, and worse, is attempting to preemptively shift
blame to the plaintiff.

Amazon's stance on this—regardless of the underlying facts regarding
their notifications and Terms of Service—seems arrogant at best.  This
isn't the first time we've seen this from Amazon.  It is not becoming to
them, and it is certainly not in the best interests of the Internet
community at large.

John Biggs, *The New York Times*, 25 Dec 2011

How much is a tweet worth? And how much does a Twitter follower cost?

In base economic terms, the value of individual Twitter updates seems to be
negligible; after all, what is a Twitter post but a few bits of data sent
caroming through the Internet? But in a world where social media's influence
can mean the difference between a lucrative sale and another fruitless cold
call, social media accounts at companies have taken on added significance.

The question is: Can a company cash in on, and claim ownership of, an
employee's social media account, and if so, what does that mean for workers
who are increasingly posting to Twitter, Facebook and Google Plus during
work hours?

A lawsuit filed in July could provide some answers. ...

I'm really surprised that this conclusion of test failure has not been
vocally challenged here.

If I do a penetration test on an untested network and am able to widely
penetrate the network do you all declare my penetration test to be a
failure?

This failure conclusion mistakes failure of the Emergency Alert System local
systems with failure of the test.

In the Emergency Response community, just like in the network security
community, a test which exposes numerous system failures is considered a
success because it identifies problems which need to be fixed.

A test of a nation-wide system which has never had end-to-end testing is not
a failure when it finds problems, it is a BIG success. The systems failed;
the test succeeded.

Hopefully we will see even more robust end-to-end tests of the Emergency
Alert System in the future, and hopefully they will also be a success by
finding problems so they can be fixed until the whole system works as
planned.

There was a failure which was pointed out, but the wrong failure was
highlighted. The FEMA website had a notice for at least two weeks prior to
this test that many cable system customers would not see the alert banners
they were used to seeing during local broadcast system tests because the
method used for the nationwide test would not trigger those banners. The
failure was that the method FEMA used to communicate this expectation did
not effectively disseminate the information to test observers.

I would have never predicted the RISK that the experts here would fail to
challenge confusion of system failure with test failure.

  [From Dave Farber's  IP distribution.  PGN]

&gt; Why did they not encrypt their credit card info?  Djf

It may be far more than just a blunder.  News reports indicate that card
numbers were obtained, which is precisely what PCI-DSS 2.0 was supposed to
prevent.  From <a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/pci_dss_v2.pdf">https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/pci_dss_v2.pdf</a>

  3.4 Render PAN unreadable anywhere it is stored (including on portable
  digital media, backup media, and in logs) by using any of the following
  approaches:

  - One-way hashes based on strong cryptography (hash must be of the entire
  PAN)
  - Truncation (hashing cannot be used to replace the truncated segment of PAN)
  - Index tokens and pads (pads must be securely stored)
  - Strong cryptography with associated key-management processes and procedures

Note: It is a relatively trivial effort for a malicious individual to
reconstruct original PAN data if they have access to both the truncated and
hashed version of a PAN. Where hashed and truncated versions of the same PAN
are present in an entity's environment, additional controls should be in
place to ensure that the hashed and truncated versions cannot be correlated
to reconstruct the original PAN.

PA-DSS covers application security and may also be relevant
<a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/pa-dss_v2.pdf">https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/pa-dss_v2.pdf</a>

As a side note, PA-DSS 2.0 has made it pretty much impossible to create and
certify open source card processing software.

         First STAMP/STPA Workshop MIT April 17-19, 2012

STAMP/STPA is a new systems thinking approach to engineering safer systems
described in Nancy Leveson's new book "Engineering a Safer World" (MIT
Press, January 2012). While relatively new, it is already being used in
space, aviation, medical, defense, nuclear, automotive, food, and other
applications.

This informal workshop will bring together those interested in improving
their approaches to safety engineering and those who are already trying this
new approach in order to share their experiences. The first day will be a
tutorial on STPA, the new hazard analysis technique built on the STAMP
accident causality model. The tutorial will be taught by Prof. Leveson and
her graduate students, who have been using STPA on my different types of
projects. The next two days will involve informal presentations by attendees
and small group meetings for specific industries and applications.

The workshop and tutorial will be free. If you are interested in attending,
please send an e-mail (for planning purposes) to leveson@mit.edu with the
following information:
     Name:
     E-mail address or contact information:
     Organization/job title:
     Industry:
     Interested in presenting? If so, what would you like to present?:

Further information will be provided in January to those who respond to this
preliminary announcement.

The workshop is sponsored by the MIT Engineering Systems Division, the
Aeronautics and Astronautics Dept., and the MIT Industrial Liaison Program
