<div class="date">Sun, 05 Jun 88 17:32:33 PDT</div>
<p>
Many readers of this digest will be interested in the article, “Information
technology and dataveillance,” Roger A. Clarke, <em>Communications of the ACM</em>,
31(5): 498 - 512, May 1988.  This is a long review with 78 references.
</p>
<p>
The author defines “dataveillance” to mean the systematic use of computing
technology in the investigation or monitoring of the actions or 
communications of one or more persons.  He distinguishes betwen “personal
surveillance” - surveillance of an identified person, where there is a
specific reason for the investigation, and “mass surveillance” - surveillance
of large groups of people in order to identify individuals who might be of
interest to investigators.  The author concludes that computing technology
is making it much easier to perform both kinds, a lot of it is going on 
and more can be expected.
</p>
<p>
The author says he does not argue that surveillance
is intrinsically evil or that it should be ruled out altogether, but 
argues that much of what is in fact now going on is in general a bad thing,
especially the mass surveillance.  He concludes that privacy and civil
liberties protections in place in most countries are inadequate to protect
against these new surveillance techniques.  The author says that he feels
people working in computing, due to their special knowledge, have some 
special responsibility to consider privacy implications of their work,
evaluate safeguards, and lobby for effective ones.

<a href="#subj2.1" id="subj2.1"><i class="flash fas fa-bolt"></i></a> RISKS of wrong numbers and tigers</h3>
<address>Steve Nuchia &lt;nuchat!steve@uunet.UU.NET&gt;</address>
<div class="date">4 Jun 88 18:32:45 GMT</div>
<p>
(Paraphrased from The Houston Post, 29 April)
</p>
<p>
A local newscast carried a story on a Herpes research project under way at
Baylor College of Medicine, and displayed a phone number for volunteers to call
— with appropriate assurances of confidentiality.
</p>
<p>
Not only was it the wrong number, it was the number for the "back door" to the
public address system at Baylor (No indication of how large an area was covered
— it is a big place.)
</p>
<p>
The callers, hearing a pick up but no answer “assumed it was an answering
machine” and “gave their names, phone numbers, everything.”
</p>
<p>
I believe this points up an important “human factor.”  People are a lot less
cautious when they initiate a contact than when they are contacted.  This
explains the easy success of the typical “service spoof” attacks - password
harvesters and “night deposit box out of order” scams.  I don't have a magic
answer for designers of services — it is very hard to design a service that is
at all hard to spoof if the clients aren't at least a little bit cautious.
</p>
<p>
Second item:
</p>
<p>
One of the tigers went through a window in a door and killed an employee.  It
was at night and the public would not have been in immediate danger even in the
daytime, but the incident nevertheless caused quite a ruckus.
</p>
<p>
The firm that designed the enclosure stated that the door design, including the
window pane used, was “standard” for that kind of application.  The tiger had
no trouble going through it, and there was no indication that it was defective,
nor that any other tiger would have had any trouble going through any other
door of like design.
</p>
<p>
(Zoo officials have the big cats in holding cages while the window materials
used in the (relatively new) cat facility are tested - by swinging miniature
wrecking balls into them.  The cat facility is a modern close-contact one - you
can routinely find one of the lionesses sleeping against a window with the
public on the other side - in a tunnel.)
</p>
<p>
Apparently quite a few nominally professional people in the world think that
standards excuse them from thinking.  Perhaps that explains the popularity of
standards?
</p>
<p>
Applicability to computers?  Gee, there aren't any people clamoring for
standards in the computer industry, are there?

<a href="#subj3.1" id="subj3.1"><i class="flash fas fa-bolt"></i></a> Academic Assignment of Viruses</h3>
<address>&lt;WHMurray@DOCKMASTER.ARPA&gt;</address>
<div class="date">Sun, 5 Jun 88 10:25 EDT</div>
<p>
A society that depends upon any mechanism for its own proper functioning,
cannot tolerate, much less encourage, any tampering with the intended
operation of that mechanism.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, one is tempted to rise up in indignation at the idea of a qualified
academic assigning a virus to his students.  The next thing you know, they will
be assigning plagiarism.  How about the forgery of academic credentials?
Perhaps we should offer a course in how to falsify research results.  Or,
perhaps, on how to trash another's experiments, notes or reports.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps it is a sign of immaturity that we are unable to recognize the moral
equivalency.  I will leave open the question of whether the immaturity is in
the technology, the society, or academia.
</p>
<p>
I thought that we put this issue to bed several years ago when we stopped
assigning the breaking of security.  It seems that we did not.
</p>
<p>
For an academic to be unable to recognize that assignments, and the recognition
that goes with their successful completion, encourages the behavior assigned,
demonstrates a lack of understanding of the activity in which he is engaged.
If he understands it, and still makes such an assignment, he demonstrates a
lack of understanding of where his real interest rests.
</p>
<p>
Such irresponsible behavior may account, in part, for the anti-academic bias in
our society and for the manifest distrust of the scientific establishment.  It
is of little wonder that the citizens of Cambridge, Massachusetts are reluctant
to trust the likes of these with genetic engineering.
</p>
<p>
If there is any lesson that we should have learned from the computer, it is
that understanding the effects of what we intend for it to do is a daunting
task.  Even getting it to do what we intend is not trivial.  It seems to me,
that there is plenty of material here for assignments; we need not look to
assignments which are at best trivial, and at worst, dangerous.

<a href="#subj4.1" id="subj4.1"><i class="flash fas fa-bolt"></i></a> Peter J. Denning on Terminology</h3>
<address>Bill Kinnersley &lt;iphwk%MTSUNIX1.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU&gt;</address>
<div class="date">Mon, 6 Jun 88 12:02:13 mdt</div>
<p>
        Subscribers to this list may be interested in the recent article““Computer Viruses” by Peter J. Denning in the <em>American Scientist</em>, vol 76page 236.  In particular, he discusses terminology.  Paraphrasing his
definitions:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Worm - a program that invades a workstation and disables it.
        &lt;one copy per machine, RAM resident, self propagation via network&gt;
</li>
<li>
Trojan horse - a program that performs some apparently useful
        function, but containing hidden code that performs an
        unwanted malicious function.
        &lt;file resident, propagation by unwitting human beings&gt;
</li>
<li>
Bacterium - a program that replicates itself wthout bound,
        thereby preempting the resources of the host system.
        &lt;many copies per machine, RAM resident, self propagating&gt;
</li>
<li>
Virus - a program that incorporates copies of itself into the
        machine code of other programs, and when those programs
        are invoked, performs a malicious function.
        &lt;two phase life cycle - RAM form with self propagation,
                                file form with human propagation&gt;
</li>
</ol>
<p>
        Denning points out that these types often occur in combination.
A Trojan Horse is the most common means of originally introducing a
virus into a system.  For example, a Trojan Horse compiler can attach
a copy of the virus code to its output.
</p>
<p>
Defence against computer viruses comes out sounding like a message
from the Surgeon General.  Practice digital hygiene yourself.  Don't
exchange programs with anyone whose computer habits are not up to
your own standards.  Refuse to use software if the manufacturer's
seal has been broken!

<a href="#subj6.1" id="subj6.1"><i class="flash fas fa-bolt"></i></a> Halon agreement and the ozone models</h3>
<address>Rob Horn &lt;harvard!ulowell!infinet!rhorn@husc6.harvard.edu&gt;</address>
<div class="date">Thu, 2 Jun 88 19:31:50 edt</div>
<p>
The real risk with the freon-halon-ozone controversy is best
understood when you realize that the Third World countries were
major opponents to the production freeze.  The major uses of
freons are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Refrigeration</li>
 <li>Manufacturing</li>
 <li>Fire Protection (only about 10%)</li>
</ol>
<p>
Freons have been shown to be much cheaper and much safer than the
alternative technologies.  Only recently have there been
indications that equally safe refrigeration technologies can be
practical, and these will be many times more expensive.
</p>
<p>
In the Third World refrigeration means much more than a cool car. 
It can mean the difference between life and death.  In food
production, refrigeration allows produce to reach markets, to be
stored safely.  Without it (and most underdeveloped countries
lack adequate refrigeration) food spoils, farm incomes drop
dramatically, people go hungry, people starve.  In medicine,
refrigeration means medicines that don't spoil and blood
transfusions.  Lack of refrigeration means death.  So the Third
World countries opposed the removal of freons.  Why agree to many
thousands of deaths just to keep the Americans happy?  The future
environmental destruction is a good reason, but with so much at
stake the evidence must be persuasive.  Even with the new
technologies, they must weigh the huge increase in costs against
their limited incomes.
</p>
<p>
The evidence from the computer models is weaker than the press
reports indicate.  The measurements of world ozone show an
<em>increase</em> of about 5% from 1960 to 1975 followed by a much
larger and faster decrease of about 15% since then.  The computer
models do not predict or explain that increase.  Their
predictions of what altitudes would have how much of a decrease
do not match the observed decreases.  The models did not predict
the Antarctic ‘hole', although this has a tentative explanation.
</p>
<p>
I believe that the real deciding factor was the intuitive
decision by the negotiators that while the models were pretty
inaccurate, the measurement data was accurate enough to make the
trend very worrisome.  The rapid action following confirmation of
the satellite data calibration is consistent with this.  It also
is evidence of a cautious approach towards computer models.  The
research level was dramatically increased, both into the
atmosphere and into freon substitutes, after the initial modeling
results were published.  Freon uses with easy substitutions
(spray propellent) were eliminated in the US.  Oddly, the
Europeans did not follow suit.  The drastic changes were studied,
but no action taken until there was much more information.
</p>
<p>
The Montreal agreement also places real emphasis on more data gathering and
analysis following the agreed freeze and reduction in production.  The
reduction goal can be met with changes in refrigeration and manufacturing
without any change in fire protection uses.  The United States may move
internally for much larger reductions.  The large chemical companies may decide
to switch production entirely when suitable substitutes are found.  Dow has
announced its intention to completely phase out freon production.  The
international agreement is to reduce somewhat, then wait for more evidence from
measurements.</p>
