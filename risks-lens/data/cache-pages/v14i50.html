<address>Debora Weber-Wulff &lt;dww@math.fu-berlin.de&gt;</address>
<i>Sat, 10 Apr 1993 08:06:08 GMT</i>
<pre>
At 14:23 on Good Friday an Intercity train leaving Berlin collided head on
with a train approaching Berlin just outside the city limits near Wannsee.
This is a portion of track that is being electrified "under pressure", as the
German Bundesbahn wants to run its ICE trains on the line from May 23. During
the week only one track is used so that workers can work on the other track.
On weekends and holidays both tracks are available. The approaching train was
a "special train" that is added to the timetable for holidays to cope with the
traffic.

The trains were only going at 30 kmh because of the construction, and at least
one of the engineers saw the collision coming: he pulled the brake and jumped
the train, his co-engineer ran towards the back of the train and was severely
injured. Both engineers in the other train and a passenger were killed, over
20 were wounded, 7 remain in the hospital this morning.

There was much finger-pointing at first: both trains appeared to have proper
signals, as they were assumed to be on different tracks; the "Stellwerk" (is
that the switch controller?) was said to have been misoperated; each train
company (Wannsee is on the border between the DR and the DB train authority:
after 3 1/2 years of reunification they still haven't got the trains sorted
out) accused the other; workers were said to have inadvertently capped an
important cable. A blanket of silence has been imposed, the officials will
neither confirm nor deny anything at the moment.

<i>Wed, 14 Apr 1993 07:38:37 GMT</i>
<pre>
The preliminary results of the train crash in Berlin on Good Friday were
published in the "Tagespiegel" this morning.

It seems that the computerized signals worked perfectly: the
"Fahrdienstleiter", the person in charge of setting the switches and the
overseeing the signals set the switch wrong - to one-way traffic (workday)
instead of two-way traffic (holiday). The computer reacted by setting the
outbound signal correctly to "halt".  The overseer believed that this was a
defect in the system, and overrode the signal by setting the temporary extra
signal (which is just for when the track is under construction) to "proceed"
without telephoning anyone to investigate the supposed signal error. The
overseer overlooked [PGN would say: oversaw] the fact that a non-regularly
scheduled train was approaching the switch, he believed that the track was
free.

The risks question: How easy should it be for a person to override such a
system?  Or is this just a question of human error, to be accepted as
"Schicksal", fate?

The current Discovery mission is monitoring ozone and several dozen other
atmospheric gases.  However, the on-board recorder does not have enough
storage for the full mission's data, and the data is supposed to be
transmitted back to earth.  Unfortunately, there is a high-rate data channel
problem on the shuttle antenna that is blocking transmission; NASA has been
unable to overcome that problem thus far.  [Source: San Francisco Chronicle,

   [Abstracted by PGN from a UPI item forwarded by ARM from
   clarinews@clarinet.com, datelined Anaheim, California]

An unidentified employee of the Anaheim Police Department apparently misused
his access to the DMV computer system to obtain the home address of a man who
had been targeted by anti-abortionists.  This led to Chris Criner's house in
Tustin CA being picketed in February 1993.

  ``It taught me I can't trust anyone,'' Criner said. ``When you find
  out the perpetrators of harassment were helped by the Anaheim Police
  Department, you wonder where does it stop.''

Under state law, unauthorized disclosure of DMV records is a misdemeanor with
penalties up to one year in jail plus a fine of $5,000.

It's that time of year, and I have just got my tax return back from the
accountant.  During 1992 I had to pay estimated tax on a capital gain from
selling stock.  The program my accountant used to calculate the amount had TWO
major bugs.

Firstly, it did not deduct the amount of state tax I was estimating I should
pay before estimating the federal.  Secondly, it ignored a foreign tax credit
when calculating alternative minimum tax.  The net result of this was a $36.8K
overpayment!  This was a well known PC-based commercial package used by many
accountants across the country.

Luckily for me, they changed the program before running the 1992 return and
found the mistake — so I am out some $700 in interest for the period.

However it brings home that the tax code is now so complex that in many cases
advisors treat the output of their programs as beyond question.  Had the error
been the other way and not been found, the consequences in penalties, etc.,
could have been very worrying.

  [ For the non-US reader, the US tax code is a gothic monstrosity that nobody
    would believe if they had not seen it.  Being English, I thought the
    Inland Revenue was bad, but the US system is mind boggling in it's
    complexity and stupidity. ]

  [ For the tax-minded, I had a very complex foreign source and foreign
    capital gain transaction with UK tax credits, the total returns (Fed and
    California) are over half an inch thick. ]

There has been a considerable amount of traffic on the net concerning
Seagate's new 3.5Gb drives that came out a few months ago.  As it turns out,
SunOS (presumably the Berkeley file system) can't handle partitions over 2 Gb
(2^31 - 1), so one is forced to install the drive in two partitions.  Didn't
MS-DOS have a similar problem only yesterday...

What went wrong?  I can't imagine it is more difficult to design, build, and
market a 3.5Gb drive than it is to write/fix a file-system implementation to
support current hardware.

I just hope this happens before we hit the secondary limit of 8 partitions
per drive, or the tertiary limit of 8 LUNs (logical units) per SCSI device!

As a "software dude" i'm somewhat embarrassed to once again have been
outdone by the "hardware dudes"!

&lt;&gt;  ``... was the result  of the operator deliberately disabling the
&lt;&gt; safety system so that he could speed up his train, sources close to the
&lt;&gt; investigation said''.

&gt;This is extremely bad, not only that the operator did it, but that he
&gt;-could- do it.

Yes and No.  A safety system that cannot be disabled is, in itself, a risk, if
the system were to malfunction.

Far better is a safety system that, when disabled, leaves unmistakable
evidence that it has been meddled with, thus allowing responsibility to be
assigned, and providing a powerful incentive NOT to disable it without
justification.

A classic example would be to put the disabling mechanism behind a pane of
glass, with a hammer nearby, and a policy that "if the glass gets broken,
you'd better be able to explain why."

&lt;&gt; ... The "fix" is to bypass the sensor, fooling the computer into
&lt;&gt; thinking the valve is properly closed.

In all fairness, they had alternate sources of information.

As was mentioned in sci.space and in RISKS a couple of days ago, they had
telemetry to monitor the temperature of the vent pipe that was downstream of
the valve and would have remained cold had the valve not in fact closed.

I don't know whether the software was told to worry about the vent pipe
temperature before the rewrite that got them off the ground, but i sincerely
hope that when they decided not to check for a valve closure indication they
also decided to check for this vent pipe temperature.  By now they should know
how this pipe temperature normally behaves.

And if the temperature doesn't rise fast enough, either the valve didn't close
or it's too cold for the %$#%&amp;$#&amp;^$*^ O-rings, anyway ;-) .

&gt; In a humorous vein, I've regularly proposed a `programmer's cruise' that
&gt; would depart on December 30, 1999.  The cruise would be 30 days long

There is a bug here.  Considering the number of people who seem to think that
2000 will NOT be a leap year, the cruise should extend at least into March!

The problem with "nnnn" in a gateway reminds me of the use of such sequences
as Telex end of message and as delimiters. I remember MMMM and LLLL so I
wouldn't be surprised at NNNN having a special significance. Perhaps they only
worked at the beginning of a line to reduce the likelihood of seeing them
during normal transmissions.
