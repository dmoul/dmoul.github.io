David Learmount, *The Telegraph*, 31 Dec 2014
<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/11318189/Too-many-pilots-cant-handle-an-emergency.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/11318189/Too-many-pilots-cant-handle-an-emergency.html</a>

Opinion piece in today's newspaper (Dec 31st, 2014) about pilots'
overreliance on computers to fly aircraft may be of interest for RISKS.
This is in the context of the recent AirAsia flight QZ8501 loss, but it also
appears to figure in Air France flight 447 plunging into the Atlantic 5
years ago.  The article summarises an FAA study (published last year) called
'The Operational Use of Flight Path Management Systems', which says:

  The FAA working group established that today's pilots have a number of
  vulnerabilities. The prime one is that if the automatics fail, the pilots
  are no longer practised in managing without them. This leads pilots to
  lose confidence in their own traditional flying abilities, so when things
  go wrong they have a tendency to try to restore failed automatic systems
  when, in fact, they should be flying the aircraft to keep it safe.

Incidentally, I'm certainly no expert, but I'd always assumed that iced-up
pitot tubes (for air-speed indicators) were a pretty routine problem for
aircraft?

I've been a regular reader of (and occasional contributor to) RISKS since
the early 80s.  In all that time, I'm not sure I have seen a proposal that
takes as insufficient a view of the real deployment arena as this one:

<a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/89042513370f4b58a2e3545513f64435/railroads-seek-one-person-crews-freight-trains">http://bigstory.ap.org/article/89042513370f4b58a2e3545513f64435/railroads-seek-one-person-crews-freight-trains</a>

Even if we ignore for a moment the long-term proposal of people-free freight
trains, going from two people to one would seem to benefit exactly one group
of people: the railroads that have to pay the other half of their road
staff.

It's not exactly like a failure on a 5000-ton train pulled by a 400-ton
locomotive is small and has little effect on the Real World...

What does surprise me in this AP piece is that AAR appears in *favor*
of one-person crews.  I guess it represents the railroad owners, though.

Jay R. Ashworth, Ashworth &amp; Associates, St Petersburg FL USA

  [By reverse induction, the railroad owners would undoubtedly love
  zero-person crews, where I presume Jay and many other RISKS readers would
  not.  PGN]

A BBC Politics article at
   <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-30234304">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-30234304</a>
asks the question in the Subject.  The Political and Constitutional Reform
Committee of MPs has recommended that the government should run online
voting pilots in the next parliament "with a view to all electors having the
choice of voting online at the 2020 general election".  According to the
article, a fellow campaigner is Lord Malloch Brown, a former minister who is
now chairing an e-voting technology company.  Unsurprisingly, Malloch Brown
claims that his company's machines "are much more secure than postal votes"
and are "very advanced, with high levels of encryption", and that "the
results can be registered and collated before hackers have time to break
into the systems".  Hmm.

At least some of the Committee seem to be clued up, but the fear has to be
that political issues will weigh more heavily than the security and other
problems that have so frequently surfaced in RISKS.

Here is a book I recommend to anyone interested in online voting: Kim
Zetter's Countdown to Zero Day: Stuxnet and the Launch of the World's First
Digital Weapon.

This book captures the zeitgeist of cyberattacks and cyberweapons better
than any other book I have come across.  It is technically accurate, but I
think extremely accessible to general audiences.  And it is a pretty
exciting and amazing story as well.  Although it does not event mention
Internet voting per se, you cannot read this book and fail to appreciate the
dangers that Internet voting would be vulnerable to.

Kim Zetter, of course, was an early journalist, and one of the best,
covering the voting wars a decade ago.

  "And that's why the current regulatory paradigm for computers, inherited
  from the 16-year-old stupidity that is the Digital Millennium Copyright
  Act, needs to change. As things stand, the law requires that computing
  devices be designed to sometimes disobey their owners, so that their
  owners won't do something undesirable. To make this work, we also have to
  criminalize anything that might help owners change their computers to let
  the machines do that supposedly undesirable thing."

  A week after the app was introduced on its website, more than 4,000 people
  had activated it, the Samaritans said, and those users were following
  nearly 1.9 million Twitter accounts, with no notification to those being
  monitored. But just about as quickly, the group faced an outcry from
  people who said the app, called Samaritans Radar, could identify and prey
  on the emotionally vulnerable—the very people the app was created to
  protect.  "A tool that 'lets you know when your friends need support' also
  lets you know when your stalking victim is vulnerable #SamaritansRadar," a
  Briton named Sarah Brown posted on Twitter. A week and a half after the
  app's introduction, the Samaritans announced it was reconsidering the

Tech Worm excerpt:

  Neither of the two blocks bode well with the Internet users of India,
  especially the developers and students. GitHub provides a very high
  performing platform for distributed revision control and source code
  management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own
  features. With its user friendly web-based graphical interface and desktop
  as well as mobile integration it is a go to tool for developers and
  computer science students.

    "Facebook Inc., Twitter Inc. and Google Inc. have started resisting
     Russian government orders to remove information about a rally next
     month in support of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, raising the
     prospect of a showdown over the Kremlin's efforts to control online
     information.

     In response to a request from Russian prosecutors, Roskomnadzor, the
     country's communications regulator, began issuing block orders for
     Russia just hours after the Moscow rally was publicized on social
     media late last week, officials said. Facebook honored the initial
     order last weekend and blocked a page promoting the event, but others
     were quickly created, attracting more attention."

FYI—Why are we doing this?  Why aren't we spending this money on putting
in rooftop solar &amp; cutting the cord to the grid entirely?

David Perera, *Politico*, 1 Jan 15
<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/01/energy-electricity-data-use-113901.html">http://www.politico.com/story/2015/01/energy-electricity-data-use-113901.html</a>

The next Big Data threat to our privacy may come from the electricity we
consume in our homes.

Smart online power meters are tracking energy use—and that data may soon
be worth more than the electricity they distribute.

The Department of Energy is publishing in January the final draft of a
voluntary code of conduct governing data privacy for smart meters, 38
million of which have already been installed nationwide.  The meters gather
information about household electricity consumption and transmit it
wirelessly at regular intervals to the supplier.  It's a key element in the
push for the so-called smart grid, a more efficient way to distribute the
nation's electricity.

But, despite the voluntary code, critics fear consumers will still be
cajoled or conned into giving up their data, not just to power companies but
to third-party data aggregators.  Too much money is at stake, they say.  And
the huge profits to be made could upend the business model of energy
utilities.  [...]

  often stall when users first try to visit encrypted webpages, creating a
  hugely frustrating problem for end users, broadband providers, and website
  operators alike. While this is a hard problem to solve, Gogo's current

A reminder of the very strong hindsight bias in Silicon Valley along with a
simplistic measure of merit and the idea that smart people can pick winners
and offering prizes as incentives. Thus we adopt policies with parts and not
wholes. It's not just Silicon Valley.  We see the same biases from those who
became rich and blame smarts rather than luck. Once one is very rich there
is enough buffer so that one gets more opportunities to be lucky and to seem
prescient by simply ignoring failures.

This is also a risk to society as the (often naive) ideas become public
policy.

A critical vulnerability in client software used to interact with Git, a
distributed revision control system for managing source code repositories,
allows attackers to execute rogue commands on computers used by developers.

The flaw affects the official Git client as well as third-party clients and
software based on the original Git code. The issue only affects
implementations running on Windows and Mac OS X, not Linux, because their
file systems are case-insensitive: NTFS and FAT for Windows and HFS+ for Mac

  conclusive evidence pointing to group of disgruntled former employees as
  the source of the attack and data theft. The Security Ledger quotes Norse
  Vice President Kurt Stammberger saying that Norse has identified a group

It's my gut feeling that this relatively simple hack actually had
nothing to do with North Korea at all—though they may be leveraging
some propaganda points from it. But of course, it's in the interests
of the commercial "cybersecurity" firms—and governments seeking
ever larger and bloated "cyberwar" budgets—to play this up as some
sort of "super hack" and to pin it on a widely despised geopolitical

It has now been announced that Google Play/YouTube and other online venues
(possibly to include Netflix at some point) are either now or soon will
enable streaming of Sony's "comedy assassination" film (at least in some
countries).

I note this specifically because I do not support censorship even of this
trash, and I feel it is completely appropriate and admirable for the film to
be made widely available in the interests of free speech.

That said, this doesn't mean you're required to watch it. A film like this
is unlikely in the extreme to bring about positive change in a horrible
place like North Korea. If anything, it could drive their insane leadership
to even further internal repression.

So my *personal* recommendation remains to ignore this film entirely, and
not reward Sony's series of unforced errors that enabled this entire mess.

&gt;stored in its centralized zone data system &lt;<a href="https://czds.icann.org/en">https://czds.icann.org/en</a>&gt;,

Before people get too panicky, CZDS is used to distribute copies of top
level domain zone files to people like me who have signed up for access.
The account info used to access it is intended to be private but the zone
data itself is what the TLDs name servers serve, so it is by any normal
definition public.  (Some TLDs imagine that their zonefiles are full of
valuable proprietary data, which tells us that they don't understand the DNS
at all.)

ICANN wrote to us, told us that they'd reset our passwords so we'd have to
use the usual forgotten password hack to re-reset them to something we know.

&gt; Re: "Your cell phone number: To give or not to give" (<a href="http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/28/41">RISKS-28.41</a>)
&gt; Dual SIM cellphones are pretty common, although for obvious reasons you're
&gt; never going to get one from a carrier.

First, I'm not so clear on how "obvious" it is as I can't figure
out the reluctance and resistance.

That being said, I've been trying for years to convince Omnipoint (where I'm
both a customer and a shareholder) to offer dual-SIM phones.

This would be a useful option for people who currently carry around two
separate phones - one for their personal use and one for work.

- at least today most phones (with one key exception - that's YOU Apple
I'm pointing at) use the same charger.

This idea is not just disruptive but also stupid—as others may have
noticed by now; if DNS is blocked in any significant way, vulnerable sites
would just revert to publicizing their IP address as part of their URL
instead of the site name, thus completely bypassing DNS lookup.

  "shed twice as much heat" is a typo?

Surely doubling the volts quadruples the power dissipated?
As my freshman students know...

(awright... V squared over R, but that doesn't scan)

At risk of sounding like a total geek, in 220V Europe the mandatory wire
colours for power cords are:

Brown - Hot (live/phase)
Blue - Cold (neutral)
Green &amp; Yellow stripes - Safety Ground (earth)

I believe that in North America they are black for hot and white for cold;
no idea what other territories use, presumably it depends on whether they're
110V or 220/240V.  Obviously for moulded cords it's impossible to verify
without cutting into the cord and damaging it, but the various territories'
safety authorities will need to be satisfied that regulations are being
complied with.
