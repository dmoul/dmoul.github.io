<i>7 Oct 86 08:14:00 PST</i>
<pre>
Models, methods, and conclusions are, as Dave Benson pointed out,
connected.  Let's explore that more.

There are at least two kinds of models: formal [well understood mathematics],
and informal [heuristics or things that just work];
and there are two approaches to model usage: induction, and deduction;
finally, a model can be in the mind of the user implicitly, or explicitly.

I'll conjecture that there is a high positive correlation between "informal,
induction, and implicitly", and an even higher positive correlation between
"formal, deduction, and explicitly."  Though a good logician would wince at
the notion of "deduction from heurustics" I'll further conjecture that all
eight cells in this model are populated,  albeit unevenly.
I'm not arguing that this SHOULD be so; I'm NOT saying HOW computer models
should work; I'm just admitting how lots of people do think.  In many cases
"fuzzy" [or worse] is a good description; e.g., we "prove" things based on a
few examples, or the opinion of an authority, often in the absence of good
scientific theory, or verifiable facts.
Humans satisfice a lot; even those of us who are primarily analytical are
also a bit pragmatic; we rarely "undo" something that works just because
we don't understand it completely.  ["Undo" means "retract" and forfeit the
benefits.  Often we do "dissect" after the fact, for better understanding.]

I think that some of the back-and-forth in RISKS is between groups at ends
of a spectrum; at  one end, there are those who are using informal models, 
based on experience, who induce conclusions from them implicitly; 
at the other end, are those who yearn for formal models, with results 
deduced explicitly.  My sympathies lie with both groups; I too yearn to
understand; but IF forced to choose, I'd take results now, and wait for 
understanding.  But in fact, I believe there's a middle course; I believe we
are already achieving some successes; and I believe we have some under-
standing.  I personally have experienced much bettter results using high
order languages, and writing modular code; hence my "understanding" that 
these techniques are "better" than some alternatives.  If this experience
is not universal, that's no surprise either.  The most intricate piece of 
code I ever wrote was an I/O driver that ran in diagnostic mode; it was very
short, more or less modular, and in a mixture of assembly and machine
language.  It solved a problem so poorly understood that I got more credit
for the project than I probably deserved.

As others in RISKS have pointed out, we need to take some care with words;
else, we'll lose the ability to understand each other.  OKAY, it was a mistake
to ever think that anyone thought that "SDI software had to be perfect."
I think that agreement represents enormous progress.   Thank you.

Now, can we proceed to define "acceptable."  [Or other terms.]
Can we begin to use some numbers?  Can we remember that Hamming was
right: "The purpose of computing is insight, not numbers."  But can we have
some numbers anyhow, just to help us understand?

Another analogy may help.  In baseball, a pitcher is credited with a "perfect
game" if no opposing batter reaches first base safely.  He doesn't have to
strike out all 27 batters; or retire each with only one pitch, by getting them
to hit easy pop-ups, or easy grounders.  [NOTE that real purists could argue
endlessly about these two cases; which is better? striking out all 27, which
requires at least 81 pitches? or retiring all 27 with only 27 pitches?]
If the definition of "perfect" is arbitrary, it doesn't matter too much, since
there are so few perfect games.  Wins, strike-outs, earned run average,
and other metrics usually help us decide who the great pitchers are.

One case we've been discussing [Viking Lander] seems to indicate that the
software was "successful" while admitting that it had flaws.  Without some
metrics, we'll rehash our differing opinions endlessly.

One closing thought about models.  It's a fact that induction is always at
risk of being upset by "the next case."  It's also true that deduction is not
able to prove anything outside the scope of the axiom set on which it is
based.  At their extremes, the one is fragile; the other, sterile.
Life should be both robust and fertile; it's more fun that way.
A judicious blending of the analytical and the practical can give us some 
clues to how near the extremes we're operating.

In Brian Randell's message (<a href="/Risks/3/77">RISKS 3.77</a>) he says:

  &gt;Indeed, it strikes me that it would be very interesting if the planned
  &gt;experiments that Nancy refers to were to cover various verification and
  &gt;testing, as well as, fault tolerance experiments. 

We are indeed doing this in the latest of our series of experiments on 
software fault tolerance (the first of which was reported in TSE in
January and the second, which involves fault detection, is currently being
written up â€” both were done jointly with John Knight at the University of
Virginia). The experiment in question, which is being conducted by Tim 
Shimeall (a Ph.D. student of mine at UCI) includes comparison of 
software fault tolerance methods with various expensive validation methods 
including sophisticated testing and code reading by hierarchical abstraction.  

We would like to include formal verification also, but have not found 
funding and other support for this yet.  John McHugh at RTI may join in 
the experiment by providing versions of the program using IBM Clean Room 
techniques (a form of formal verification along with software reliability 
growth modeling is used in the development of the programs), but again 
we have not yet found funding.

The programs involve a battle management application (the Viking
problem did not turn out to be appropriate) which is based on a real
program developed by TRW (who are partially funding the experiment).
Twenty versions of the program are currently under development, and we 
should be able to report some results by next summer.

Apparently the second Tomahawk test failure was due to a bit dropped
by the hardware, resulting in the accidental triggering of the ABORT
sequence.  (Readers may recall that a parachute opened and the missile
landed safely.)

I would just like to point out the software engineering dilemma
of dealing with RISKy systems.

&gt; Subject:  Overrides and tradeoffs
&gt; Accidents in general are fairly low-probability events.

This is in inverse proportion to the use of effort taught by the 90-10
rule (90% of the time is used by 10% of the code and other variants).
RISKs are a case where the remaining 10% taking the other 90% of the time.
Perhaps, we should think about the 10% first (error handling)
and worry about the high probability events last?  I don't know,
but I did give an example earlier where this was the case.

The best work I have seen on this stuff is work by Kahneman and
Tversky, who identify two "heuristics" that people use to estimate
probability â€” availability and representativeness.  Availability is
the ease with which one can remember a particular event, so that if
you have direct experience with something, it is more salient in your
mind, and thus you think that it is more likely.  Representativeness
is using the extent to which the features of a particular situation
match your general conception of a class of situations to determine
the probability that the situation is a member of the class, rather
than using other kinds of information to make that judgment.

A great review book on the subject is "Judgment under Uncertainty:
Heuristics and Biases", edited by Daniel Kahneman, Paul Slovic, Amos
Tversky, Cambridge University Press, 1982.

Availability and representativeness explain A LOT!

   [NOTE:  By the way, speaking of REPRESENTATIVEness, Herb has
   accepted a full-time position for one year as a "Congressional
   Fellow", sponsored by the American Association for the Advancement
   of Science.  (The purpose of the Congressional Fellowships is to take
   professional scientists, engineers, social scientists, etc. and expose
   them to the policy-making process and in turn contribute some
   scientific expertise to the decision-making process.)  It seems to me
   wonderful that he is willing to spend a year in such an enterprise.
   We expect Herb to continue participating in RISKS as an integral part
   of his job, and hope to have some inside RISKS SCOOPS.  Perhaps RISKS
   can even have an impact on Congress!  PGN]

     It has recently been suggested in this forum that software whose
environment changed over time (requiring a change in the functional
specification) might become "old" and "rotten".  One example given was
that of financial software which can't handle high inflation rate
(having insufficient number of digits in various total fields).

     Well, here in Israel we have already gone through two currency
changes: in 1977 we changed the currency from Lira to Shekel (which
was 10 Liras) and in 1985 we change it again from Shekel to new Shekel
(which equals 1000 old Shekels).  These changes affected every piece
of financial software in the market, and before each change there was
usually a period in which financial software had to be adjusted to
have more digits in total fields.  In addition to this, we had gone
from an inflation rate whose peak was 21% per month to an average 2%
per month inflation.

     Most packages survived the changeovers rather easily.

     The morale of this is - even if the environment changes
drasticly, software doesn't have to die. It all depends on how much
you are willing to pay the physicians (maintenance programmers).  Only
the software which was bad to start with (i.e. didn't sell well) will
die due to natural selection.

    Software as it exists in the programming language (and mathematical
statements) is theoretically perfect â€” a Platonian Ideal. Yet there is
a risk that the software as it is embedded in the hardware will become
distorted and "worn out".  Between background radiation, hardware
failures causing bit-changes (the resistor lets too little or too much
current through, causing a "1" to be read as a "0"), and people-caused
hardware failures (bent pins, crimped cables, etc.), there is the chance
for distortions in the software. In "Bad Bits" (Scientific American,
Feb. 1980, p. 70, there is a reference to radiation failures
(presumably from background radiation) causing random failures â€” I
believe the figures are 3,000 / million hours of operation in a 256k
charge-coupled device. 
    I do not think these sources are currently a major part of the
"software failures" in the industry; design, specification and
maintenance problems seem to be far more prevalent because of the lack
of attention paid to human engineering problems â€” the basic presumption
seems to be that Murphy's Law doesn't hold for people (programmers or
administrators or scientists). As computing machines become more "dense"
though, this real possibility of unpredictable failure ought to be
considered.

<i>Mon, 6 Oct 86 18:16:53 pdt</i>

JS&gt;Dave Benson nicely identifies a distinction between becoming obsolete
JS&gt;and wearing out, and argues that only the former applies to software.

Thank you, but not quite. Software can also become lost, dissipate or
in various other manners disappear.  One way this might occur is if
all copies of the media containing the bit patterns wore out.  But in
most situations, software becomes obsolete before it disappears.

JS&gt;There is another effect that isn't exactly captured by the words "to
JS&gt;become obsolete." ...
JS&gt;Some people have in mind the impairment and diminished usability
JS&gt;caused by this effect when they use words like "wears out" or "rots".

Software suffers so-called "maintenance" since the changing requirements
require modification.  This is common enough in other engineered
artifacts:  Coal-fired steam plants have exhaust scrubbers added, etc.
The diminished usability in software is caused by the rapidly changing
external conditions, thus "obsolesence" is an entirely appropriate term.
The fact that the re-engineering of the artifact in the attempt to
keep the artifact current is poorly done only causes the artifact to
become obsolete more rapidly than if the re-engineering was done well.

JS&gt;I guess we need a plain English word for it so that neophytes won't
JS&gt;think that computers that haven't been oiled properly rub too hard
JS&gt;on the bits.
How about "obsolete"?  Here are some examples.  Some are fact, others
fiction, still others opinion.  Decide whether the word fits before
coining a new term.

  Arpanet is rapidly showing its obsolescence
  under the dramatically increased traffic.  While the obsolescence of the
  Enroute Air Traffic Control System is appearent to the controllers, it
  is judged that providing computers with 3 times current speed will keep
  the system operational until the year 2010.  The financial transaction
  system of the Bank of Calichusetts is showing its obsolesence by the
  large losses to so-called computer criminals.  Unix will be obsolete by
  the year 2010, then being replaced by Yaos, which is currently in
  advanced engineering at the Yet Another Company.  The LGP-30 is an
  obsolete computer.  Sage is an obsolete software system. SDI sofware
  will be obsolete before it is written.

I shudder at the thought that this may become so popular that the gerund
"obsolescing" will appear on RISKS.

Hammersmith Hospital, in London England, closed down its research
cyclotron last year. The cyclotron was the first ever to be dedicated
to medical research and applications (mostly, production of
radioactive tracer chemicals and treatment of cancer with neutron
beams), and began running in 1955.  According to one of the physicists
on the staff, who gave a seminar at the University of Washington
yesterday, an important factor in the decision to close the facility
was that the original designer is scheduled to retire this year, and
he is the one person who really understands how to keep it going and
modify it.  England's Medical Research Council (or MRC, sort of like
NIH in this country) is building a replacement cyclotron at a
different site at the cost of many millions of pounds.

   Federal officials say a problem-plagued air traffic control system installed
 at many U.S. airports four years ago probably will be replaced before most of
 the equipment is ever used. The multimillion-dollar system was supposed to
 make radar screens clearer, help track aircraft that do not carry radar signal
 equipment and otherwise relieve some of the load on the existing system. But
 engineers have been stumped by programming problems that have rendered the
 Sensor Receiver and Processor System, or SRAPS, virtually useless, the Orange
 County Register reported Saturday. The agency expects a new $500 million
 Westinghouse system ordered 2 1/2 years ago to arrive in November or December
 for testing, said FAA engineer Marty Pozesky. Known as the ASR-9, for Airport
 Surveillance Radar, the system will affect virtually every U.S. airport, he
 said, adding it may be four years before it is fully operating. The SRAPS
 computers were purchased in 1981 from the now-defunct Sperry Univac
 Information Storage Systems. Researchers at the successor company, Sperry,
 have continued to seek a solution to the software problems, but no longer have
 the help of FAA engineers, Pozesky said. "We don't think the solution will be
 there, so we have really stopped searching," Pozesky said by telephone
 Saturday from his Silver Spring, Md., home.
