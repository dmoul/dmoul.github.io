There was an article on the business page of the "Tagespiegel" this morning
on the problems plaguing the German railway company. I had meant to post the
problems to risks when it began, but you know how it goes.... So anyway, it
is now the fourth month that the railway has not correctly met its payroll
because of software problems and the natives, er, workers are rather
restless.

The railway has just recently been privatized and the employees transferred
from civil service to private contracts. Calculating a civil service payroll
in Germany is not for the faint at heart, there are all sorts of little
additions and deductions. The unions had insisted that the pay remain more
or less the same, and worked out a new, different but still complicated
schedule of pay adjustments. Now the fun begins.

Some people don't get paid at all. One who now longer works for the railway
received a notice that he owes them 1.61 DM. Many people that normally make
3000-4000 DM a month receive only 900. And then there are the apprentices
who normally make just 1000 a month - they seem to be getting somewhere on
the order of 15000 DM a month... interestingly enough, the Bahn manages to
call the overpayments back lickety split. The other direction is not so
easy. Last month they offered to give everyone 2000 DM extra until
everything gets straightened out. That didn't work either, with some being
asked to pay the Bahn money and others having big payroll deductions wipe
most of it out.

What did the Bahn do? Amazingly, this is being programmed in-house. And since
there is no responsible leader of the programming department (!), they
have hired someone for that job (probably so that they can fire him next
month...). "It's just a software problem" they say. And the payroll is so
large, it cannot be done by hand. Employees are being asked to keep track of
what they get and what they think they should get.

[Ah, did I mention, they jacked up the prices for travelling by train the
beginning of February? That's another story, but I think I know what they
need the money for now....]

  we have a Bahn-fire of the Sanities?  PGN]

I noticed an interesting AP newswire story in the LA Times Business section
(p. D2) on January 31, 1995.  The only problem was that it appeared to have
a final paragraph from a much earlier story appended to the end.  The
phrasing matched well enough that it took a while to realize that we did
not, indeed, invade Japan over the issue.  I enclose the last two
paragraphs:

Headline:  Japan Worker's Pay Surges to New High; U.S. Trails

   ...
      Some of the increas in Japan reflects the decline value of the
  dollar against the yen, and the effect of Japan's higher wageds is
  offset by generally higher prices for consumer goods.
      Indeed, the U.S. forces that begin landing on the island today
  will depend explicitly on Cedras' cooperation for their success.  One
  of the first tasks of the commander of the U.S. expeditionary force,
  Lt. Gen. Henry Hugh Shelton, will be an official call on Cedras.

The Wednesday, 8 Feb 1995, International Herald Tribune has a very short
item on "Portuguese Plastic".  The AP picture shows a pair of open hands
holding both a few pretty coins and a single less pretty smart card.

The card has snappy graphics (including a picture of coins) and I count
about 9-electrical contact pads for getting at the smarts.

Some details:

  o "Spending limit of $375".  (Presumably 60,000 Escudos.)
  o "Does not have a user's name on it".
  o "Requires no secret codes".
  o It can have new value put in it using an automatic teller machine.
  o Written on the card is: "Porta Moedas Multibanco" and "Caixa Geral
    de Depositos".
  o The picture seems to show a dark fuzzy printed serial number,
    maybe 12-digits long.
  o For incidental purchases, merchants' readers will be cheap and
    autonomous if it really can be used to buy "newspapers,
    cigarettes, or a cup of coffee".

Missing Details:

  o Is the system publicly documented and secure, or is it security
    through obscurity?
  o Does it have the user's name *in* it?  (Is it anonymous, or not?)
  o Who issues it?  (Who will get burned if it is hacked?)
  o When will it start running?
  o What *is* the underlying system?

Risks issues?  I think the most interesting will be the public's sense of
the risks, what they are told, and whether they "buy" it.

  My father is a security investigator for a major national
"Less-Than-Truckload" freight carrier.  Recently a string of major shippers
have been hit by weekend thefts up and down the North Atlantic seaboard.
The most recently pilfered items were $270,000 of long distance prepaid
calling cards.  These apparently are gaining acceptance as both a debit card
and/or collectible item depending upon the picture on the card.

  When the trucking firm contacted the owner of the shipped cards and told
them of the theft, they had no way of de-activating the stolen cards.
Even knowing the lot numbers, etc., they do not have the software in place
to render the cards obsolete.  So goodbye $270,000 in calls, and assuming
they are sold for 50 cents on the dollar at the Port Authority Terminal,
hello $135,000 for the bad guys.

I'm submitting this to illustrate the RISKS of trying to print a document
from a remote laptop through a network and assuming that it will come out on
the right device.

I work at a small daily newspaper which uses Macs, PCs, and a mainframe in
its network.  In addition to small laser printers and dot-matrix printers we
have output devices that can produce 13 x 21.5" pages on regular paper, "RC"
paper, or film negative.  The film costs $1 per inch of depth so we're
always being admonished to be careful not to waste it.

We have two reporters who started a self-publishing project last year, a
fiction zine called _Sludgecone_.  They have been using the newspaper's
facilities to produce their camera-ready pages, although their actual
printing was done at a copy shop.

The other day one of them decided to print out all the raw, unedited copy
(24 pages) for the second issue.  He was at his house with his laptop, and
logged in to our system intending to print them out on 8.5 x 11" paper on
one of the small laser printers.  Unfortunately for him it did not go there,
but rather to film.  Each page came out on 13 x 21.5" film.  24 pages at $1
an inch, with 4 inches between pages, added up to $600 worth of wasted film.

At this time I don't know what's going to happen but I'd guess that this
unfortunate person and his partner will be forbidden from using the
newspaper facilities to produce _Sludgecone_, and they might have the $600
taken out of their paychecks.

<h3><a name="subj6.1" id="subj6.1">RISKS of Third-Party-Billed Calls</a></h3>
<address>Micah Altman &lt;micah@cco.caltech.edu&gt;</address>
<i>7 Feb 1995 21:56:41 GMT</i>
<pre>
The following is a summary of a recent personal experience with PacBell.
While I have not seen this precise RISK mentioned in the digest, it is
a variant on a theme familiar to risk readers.

While reviewing my January residential local phone bill I noticed an
unfamiliar entry under the heading of "Operator and System-Assisted Calls".
Listed under this heading was a short call, marked as a "system assisted 3rd
party call". Both destination and source numbers were listed, but I
recognized neither.

This afternoon I called the PacBell billing center for an explanation and
correction.  The service representative, Brian, was straightforward
and polite. He informed me of the following:
- This call was made from another residential number, the person who made
  the call simply requested that it be billed to my number.
- When a 3rd-party-billed call is made from a residential number,
  "9 times out of ten the operator making the call will NOT ASK FOR ANY
  VERIFICATION (emphasis added)"

Let me stress that this was not a case of a pilfered PIN, or "calling card"
number. I have never requested or received a "calling card" from PacBell, so
there there should be no such account number to steal. It would seem that
PacBell simply allows calls to be billed to other numbers with no
verification at all.

While PacBell offered to credit the call they did not offer to block such
calls until I explicitly asked whether there was any way to prevent the
situation from recurring.

While I consider myself to be a reasonably well-informed consumer, prior to
this incident I was neither aware of the procedures used for 3rd party
billing, nor of the blocking service available for such calls (at the time I
initially ordered phone service I explicitly requested all blocks that were
then offered).

With the plethora of phone calling cards with, at least, weak
authentication, third-party billing seems to be a service of little value.
Making such a service available without verification is unconscionable.

The RISKS of the situation are obvious.

 &gt; I think millions of people will be prepared to believe all sorts of other
 &gt; nonsense--and, alas for the victims, act upon those mistaken beliefs.

One problem is that what constitutes "nonsense" is a floating target.  There
are (or have been) for-pay phone-sex lines which operate from 800 numbers,
much to the dismay of concerned parents who have already blocked 900 numbers
on their home phones with the help of their telco and have no way to screen
for 800 numbers, too.  (It should be noted that many telcos are working now
to eliminate this sort of bait-and-switch.)

It's not unlikely that a commercial phone service could make free
long-distance phone calls available; I've seen booths in shopping malls from
various long distance vendors encouraging you to try a free phone call to
anywhere to check the quality of their phone line.

The RISK, as with all urban legends, is that of poor authentication --
either of the purported author or of the content of the message.
Relying on "common sense" in a rapidly changing age is not necessarily
as easy at sounds (if it ever was that easy...).

In <a href="/Risks/16/79">RISKS-16.79</a> Phil Agre mentioned Digital cash payment schemes for orad
tolls but assumed that such systems have not yet been proposed, much less
implemented. Fact is that in Sweden there is an undergoing major national
road toll project which in 1996/97 will introduce such a system, based of
transponders plus smart cards. Cards may be filled with cash at various
places, gas stations etc. Privacy issues are of concern, so a Digital cash
system is necessary; still there remains the potential (risk) for systematic
tracking of travel patterns. This will be of considerable concern from the
Data Inspectorate. The system will be able to make the recording at speeds
around 80 km/h (50 mph). Cars without the right equipment will be
photographed - unless you pay at the manual gate of course.

Management Analytics is offering (in a test mode only) the ability to
scan sites over the Internet for well-known over-the-wire security holes.

The service is available from Mosaic (via W3) at the URL:
        <a href="http://all.net:8080">http://all.net:8080</a>

Comments are welcomed, and a lively debate is anticipated.

How does the attack scanning process work?

    We have collected and written a set of attack programs that
automatically probe systems in the same way as many attackers probe them.
When you request an attack, the computer at all.net launches the attack
against the specified machine, logs the results, and E-mails the results out.

How do you keep this process safe? &lt;/h2&gt;

    Since the attacks are launched from all.net, we don't give out the
attack code in the process of testing.  The results are E-mail'ed to
postmaster@the.attacked.machine so that only the systems administrator
responsible for dealing with postal problems at the machine under scan gets
the result.  These results are posted along with the identifying information
about the person and site that requested the attack so that the action is
traceable.  Finally, all.net is identified as the source in a separate
posting to the systems administrator of the machine.  All of the attacks are
well known and the programs we use are widely available in source form for
free over the Internet.
