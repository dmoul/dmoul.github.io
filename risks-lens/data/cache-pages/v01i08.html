<p>
I had not intended to get involved in the RISKS Forum discussions, but
despite my great respect for John McCarthy's accomplishments, I just cannot
let his latest message (<a href="/Risks/1/8">RISKS-1.8</a>, Sept. 8) pass without comment.
</p>
<p>
Some important points that need to be considered:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Nothing is completely safe.  All activities and technologies involve
risk.  Getting out of bed is risky — so is staying there.  Nitrates have
been shown to cause cancer — not using them may mean that more people will
die of food poisoning.
</li>
<li>Technology is often introduced for the mere sake of using the “latest,”
sometimes without considering the fact that the situation may not really be
improved.  For example, everybody seems to be assuming lately that machines
will make fewer mistakes than humans and there is a frantic rush to include
computers and “artificial intelligence” in every new
product.  Where speed is the determining factor, then they may be right.  Where intelligent
decision making in the face of unforeseen situations and factors is
foremost, then it may not be true.  Some electro-mechanical devices may be
more reliable than computers.  Since I am identified with the area of
“software safety,” I am often consulted by those building safety-critical
software systems.  It is appalling how many engineers insist that computers
do not make “mistakes” and are therefore safer than any other human or
electro-mechanical system.  We (as computer scientists) have often been
guilty of condoning or even promoting this misconception.  Often it seems
that the introduction and use of non-scientific and misleading terminology
(e.g. “intelligent,” “expert”, “proved correct”)has far outstripped the introduction of new ideas.
</li>
<li>
Technology introduced to decrease risk does not always result in 
increased safety.  For example, devices which have been introduced into
aircraft to prevent collisions have allowed reduced aircraft separation
with perhaps no net gain in safety (although there is a net gain in efficiency 
and profitability).  There may be certain risk levels that people are
willing to live with and introducing technological improvements to reduce
risks below these levels may merely allow other changes in the system which
will bring the risks up to these levels again.
</li>
<li>
Safety may conflict with other goals, e.g. productivity and efficiency.
Technology that focuses on these other goals may increase risk.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
John McCarthy suggests that people ignore the risks of not using technology.
I would suggest that it is not that these risks are ignored, but that they
are known and we have learned to live with them while the risks of using new
technology are often unknown and may involve great societal upheaval in
learning to adapt to them.  Yes, wood smoke may cause lung cancer, but note
that recent studies in Great Britain show that the incidence of prostate
cancer in men who work in atomic power plants is many times that of the
general population.  To delay introducing technology in order to assure that
greater risks are not incurred than are currently borne by the population
seems justifiable.  Yes delay may cause someone's death, but the
introduction may cause even more deaths and disruption in the long-run.
</p>
<p>
The solution is to develop ways to assess the risks accurately (so that
intelligent, well-informed decision-making is possible) and to develop ways
to reduce the risk as much as possible.  Returning to the topic of computer
risk, citizens and government agencies need to be able to make informed
decisions about such things as the safety of fly-by-wire computer-controlled
commercial aircraft or between computer-controlled Air Traffic Control with
human-assistance vs. human-controlled Air Traffic Control with computer
assistance.  To do this, we need to be able to assess the risks and to
accurately state what computers can and cannot do.
</p>
<p>
Forums like this one help to disseminate important information and promote
the exchange of ideas, But we also need to start new initiatives in computer
science research and practice.  I have been writing and lecturing about this
for some time.  For example,
</p>
<ol>
<li>we need to stop considering software reliability as a matter of
     counting bugs.  If we could eliminate all bugs, this would work.  But
     since we cannot at this time, we need to differentiate between the
     consequences of “software failures.”
</li>
<li>
Once you start to consider consequences of failures, then it is possible
     to develop techniques which will assess risk.
</li>
<li>
Considering consequences may affect more aspects of software than just
     assessment.  Some known techniques, such as formal verification and
     on-line monitoring, which are not practical to detect all faults may be
     applied in a cost-effective manner to subsets of faults.  Decisions may
     be able to be made about the use of competing methodologies in terms of
     the classes of faults that they are able to detect, remove, or tolerate.
     But most important, by stating the “software problem” in a different way      (in terms of consequences), it may be possible to discover new approaches
     to it.  My students and I have been working on some of these.  Most
     software methodologies involve a “forward” approach which attempts to     locate, remove, or tolerate all software faults.  An alternative is to
     take a backward approach which considers the most serious failures and
     attempts to determine if and how they could occur and to protect the
     software from taking these actions.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
If using some of these techniques (or despite their use), it is determined
that the software would be more risky than conventional systems or is above
a minimum level of acceptable risk, then we can present decision makers with
these facts and force them to consider them in the decision-making process.
Just citing horror stories or past mistakes is not enough.  We need ways of
assessing the risk of our systems (which may involve historical data
presented in a statistically proper manner) and ways to decrease that risk
as much as possible.  Then society can make intelligent decisions about
which systems should and should not be built for reasons of acceptable or
unacceptable risk.

<a href="#subj1.2" id="subj1.2"><i class="flash fas fa-bolt"></i></a> Risks of omissions</h3>

<p>
The question of responsibilities for non-use of computers are largely
meaningless in terms of law unless the dangers of non-use were known to
substantially increase the probability of greater harm. In the case of your
three short examples:
</p>
<ol>
<li>If the ACLU had acted in good faith in seeking to limit sharing of
police information and a court had looked favorably on their argument after
weighing the possible risks, then the court is responsible because only the
judge had the ability to decide between two courses of action. To make the
ACLU responsible would be to deny it and its point of view access to due
legal process. To make it necessary for the ACLU to anticipate the court's
response to its bringing suit would have the same chilling effect on our
legal system.
</li>
<li>
The same argument applies to the Sierra Club and US 101.  If US 101 had
been built and then some people were killed, one could as easily conclude
that the Sierra Club (or anyone else) might be sued for NOT obstructing the
highway!
</li>
<li>
The “Split Wood not Atoms” poster-vendor might be sued if it could beconclusively proven that he was a knowing party to a conspiracy to give
people lung cancer. But we might assume that his motivation was actually to
prevent a devastating nuclear accident that might have given 10,000 people
lung cancer…
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Again, a risks-of-computers organization can only present its case to court
and people and, so long as no malfeasance is involved, cannot be held
responsible for its failure to predict future consequences. There are far
more important “unsymmetric” relationships than that of the press vs. thelegal system that pertain to issues of responsibility, namely, that of past
vs. future and known vs. unknown. I feel that you are correct in pointing
out how computer people would do well to apply their expertise to solving
problems of society. In this case the moral imperitives are quite clear.

<div class="date">Sun, 8 Sep 85 15:51:44 EDT</div>
<blockquote>
        The problem with a forum on the risks of technology is that
    while the risks of not using some technology, e.g. computers, are
    real, it takes imagination to think of them…
</blockquote>
<p>
You raise an interesting point that deserves more discussion.
However, as one who is concerned that the major problem arises from an
uncritical acceptance of technology, I strongly disagree with your
suggestion that the scales are stacked AGAINST those who are
“pro-technology“.  The reason that anyone adopts any given technology
is that it provides benefits that he can see; the problem is getting
those individuals to see that there are costs as well.  In other
words, the bias in the system is towards acceptance of technology, not
rejection of it.  It is this general bias that “risks” people are
trying to correct.
</p>
<blockquote>    … Is a risk-of-computers
    organization that successfully sues to delay a use of computers either
    MORALLY or LEGALLY LIABLE if the delay causes someone's death?  Is there
    any moral or legal requirement that such an organization prove that they
    have formally investigated whether their lawsuit will result in killing
    people?  As the above examples indicate, the present legal situation
    and the present publicity situation are entirely unsymmetric.</blockquote>
<p>
There are such precedents; organizations can be held liable for using
technology that that is not as up to date as is “generallyapplicable”.On the more general point, it is much harder toestablish liability as the result of someone's inaction as compared to
the result of someone's action; this does happen, but it is harder to
prove.
</p>
<blockquote>
    The harm caused by tape-to-tape batch processing as opposed to on-line
    systems.</blockquote>
<p>
I like this example; let's have more discussion of it.  There was a
time when on-line systems were totally unreliable, but I think that
time has past.
</p>
<blockquote>
    Shouldn't computer professionals
    who pretend to social responsibility take an interest in an
    area where their knowledge might actually be relevant?</blockquote>
<p>
This is a cheap shot unworthy of pioneers in computer science.  More
than anyone else, computer professionals are the ones who are in the
best position to assess the limits as well as the promises of
technology.  You once said that the responsibility of the scientist is
to take his science whereever it may lead.  I agreed with you then,
and I agree with that now.  But science is part of a social and
cultural context, and cannot be separated as cleanly as one might
imagine.  If it is proper for the developers of science and technology
to propose new applications of their work (because they see these
potential applications as beneficial to society), it is also
appropriate for them to suggest possible consequences of their use as
well.

<ol>
<li>McCarthy's contribution can be summarized simply,  “Life is 
full of tough decisions about when to use technology; we have to
consider both sides.”  Those who have been concerned with the risks
of computer technology have been saying, “There are risks to using
computer technology; we have to consider both sides”.  I sense 
agreement on the obvious conclusion.
</li>
<li>
I can disagree only with one aspect of Weizenbaum's contribution.
He says that he would be against SDI even if it would work, but his arguments
mainly show even more reasons why it won't “make nucelar weapons impotent
and obsolete.“  It is probably useless to argue about how we would feel 
about the system if it would work, but I feel the decision would be much 
harder to make than it is now.</li>
</ol>
<p>
    While I would prefer not to waste technological resources on such a thing,
I would see some truth in the argument that the non-technological solutions 
also have a clear risk of failure.

<div class="date">08 Sep 85  1108 PDT</div>
<p>
Assuming, contrary to fact, that putting a faster clock
in your AT would cause it to catch fire, the RISKS contributors are
quite wrong about who would be sued.  According to the new legal
doctrine of  bursae profundae,  it isn't the poor BBOARD operator
that would have to pay but rich IBM.  It wouldn't take much of a lawyer
to figure out that IBM should have anticipated that someone might
do this and warned against it or even somehow made it impossible.
</p>
<p>
Changing the subject, consider the effect of the court decision that
NOAA was liable for not fixing the buoy.  Up to now weather predictionshave been offered as a non-guaranteed service with the user taking
responsibility for the extent to which he relies on it.  The court
has said that this is no longer possible.  Any institution with
“deep pockets” cannot safely offer information on a user responsibility
basis.  What if Stanford University has negligently failed to
replace a stolen book from its medical library, and someone dies
who would have been saved had his doctor found the book?  Stanford's
lawyers should advise Stanford to deny access to its medical library
to practicing physicians.

My primary complaint about your otherwise interesting table is that it
assumes independent failure modes.  I think it is much more likely
that the effects of coupled failures are larger.  In particular, given
the failure of one platform, it is more likely that more than one will
fail.

The example of squirreled non-printing characters is of course just 
one example; that one was relatively easy to fix once it was recognized. 
But until you have discovered a flaw, you are vulnerable.  And you never
know how many flaws remain undiscovered.

<p>
Sure, <em>you</em> may be smart, but large operating systems generally have many
security flaws.  <em>You</em> probably aren't smart enough to design and build a

[By the way, let me add before someone comments, a message that causes
grief when read would be a Trojan horse.  A message that propagates itself
— as in the case of the ARPANET collapse on 27 Oct 1980 — would be

Sure, <em>you</em> may be smart, but large operating systems generally have many
security flaws.  <em>You</em> probably aren't smart enough to design and build a
system that has none.  (In fact, your solution is not quite good enough
by itself &amp;8212; without some other assumptions on the rest of your system.)
</blockquote>
<p>
I certainly recognize that operating systems have security flaws in
them, having been an OS hacker myself at one time.  But for the
problem of messages (as opposed to programs) doing bad things to my
system, I guess I never figured out a way of doing that.
</p>
<p>
My naive model is that I have a special program that intercepts the
raw bit stream that comes in from my communications port.  It then
translates this into ASCII, and then prints it on my screen.  
</p>
<p>
If this is all that my program does, I can't see what harm can be
done.
</p>
<p>
Now, if my program writes the message to disk, then I can see
potential problems.  So I simply count the characters that are sent to
me over the line, and save exactly that many characters on disk.
</p>
<p>
What am I missing?

Herb, Indeed your model is a bit naive, in that you are looking at the
problem much to narrowly, and assuming that <em>everything else</em> works fine.
Suppose that your special program would work as you wish in intercepting the
raw bit stream.  Suppose, however, that there is an operating system flaw
that lets me change your special program to do what I wish! (There are many
examples of how this might happen.)  Now your program can be effectively
bypassed.  The point is NOT whether you can seal off one hole, but rather
that you are dealing with the tip of an iceberg and there may be titanic
holes you don't even know about.  Besides, as I said earlier, the message
squirreling is only one example — and hopefully completely cured.  So I
hope you don't reply that you could use seals to guarantee that your program
is unchanged.  That would still miss the broader point.  PGN
