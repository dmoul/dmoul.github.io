The Voting News Daily, a news service of Verified Voting

A CIA asset reportedly pulled from Russia in 2017 played a major role in the
agency's determination that Russian President Vladimir Putin personally
ordered Moscow's meddling in the 2016 election, according to *The New York
Times*.  The informant, while not in Putin's inner circle, interacted with
him regularly and was privy to decision-making at high levels of the Russian
government, according to The Times. Information on the informant's identity
was so carefully guarded that it was kept out of then-President Obama's
daily security briefings in 2016, instead transmitted in separate sealed
envelopes.  In 2016, high-level CIA officials ordered a full review of the
source's record and grew suspicious he might have become a double agent
after he rejected an offer of exfiltration from the agency, according to the
Times.  Other officials said these concerns were alleviated when the source
was offered a second time and accepted.

The Open Privacy Research Society has discovered that the sensitive medical
information of patients being admitted to certain hospitals across the
Greater Vancouver Area is being broadcast, unencrypted, by hospital paging
systems, and that these broadcasts are trivially interceptable by anyone in
the Greater Vancouver Area.

The data being broadcast includes the patients name, age, gender marker,
diagnosis, their attending doctor and room number. Other broadcasts
regarding medical tests such as x-rays are often associated with a patients
last name or medical number, exposing their progression through hospital
departments. Some broadcasts appear to contain freeform text, allowing other
sensitive information to be entered as well. We have been able to confirm
the authenticity of this data by cross-referencing records with public
obituaries.

“In the mid-1990s boy scout David Hahn used household objects and his
scientific knowledge to start building a nuclear reactor in his
backyard. Police and the Environmental Protection Agency stopped him before
he could finish. Twenty years later, revolutions in manufacturing and
computing have made projects such as Hahn's a lot more feasible; if he had
access to a 3-D printer, for example, he might have finished his reactor
before authorities intervened. Modern technologies also mean one does not
need to be as smart as Hahn to create at least some kinds of DIY
weapons. With the right machine and blueprints anyone can build a handgun in
their living room—and firearms are just the beginning.  Researchers fear
that artificial intelligence and 3-D printing might one day create, on
demand, weapons of mass destruction.''

The WMD Do-It-Yourself kit is a frightening possibility. Can a 3-D printer
enable WMD deployment of a chemical or biological device?

Thanks to Graham Allison's efforts, and the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat
Reduction legislation of 1991, WMD material (enriched uranium and plutonium,
biological/chemical) became more difficult to acquire as the Soviet Union
disintegrated.  Threat reduction implementation tapered substantially after
Russia annexed Crimea.

<a href="https://time.com/5675566/airbus-airplane-bathroom-tracker/">https://time.com/5675566/airbus-airplane-bathroom-tracker/</a>

“The Airbus Connected Experience aims to give flight attendants a more
detailed survey of the cabin, with sensors for such critical data as when
bathroom soap is running low and how much toilet paper remains in each
bathroom. But the rethinking of the passenger environment doesn't just stop
with the lavatory. At each seat, your belt will signal red for unbuckled and
green when fastened. The goal is faster boarding and departure, dispensing
with those lap-scrutinizing walk-throughs flight attendants must
perform. The crew will also have access to information on what's onboard and
where, like which galley carts contain specific meals, such as pre-orders or
vegetarian selections.''

What happens if there's a faulty or intermittent seat belt lock/unlock
sensor? Will each flier be required to wear an RFID tag that is scanned when
entering and exiting the toilet? Will airlines compile a passenger
`compliance score' and use it to raise or lower ticket prices, or deny
purchase, based on profiled compliance history?

Plenty of schools have incentive programs for students who attend games, but
ones who give demerits for early exits are harder to find.

  [On the limits of computer searching:]

Mary Branscombe for 500 words into the future, ZDNet, 12 Sep 2019

Artificial intelligence might have passed a school science test but when
everyday tasks are still well beyond it's ability, we can't even talk about
building general purpose AI.

opening text:

For the last few weeks, we've been watching a plant grow on our windowsill.
A seed blew into the window box and took root, and started to shoot up.

There was nothing growing in that end-of-the-window box, so we left it until
we could see whether it was a weed or a nice plant.

The seed had been long and black, and the stem grew tall and spindly.  Once
we could see a few leaves, I started searching the web for a plant with a
long, hairy stem and long, pointed leaves springing alternately from the
stem, that grow in the UK from long black seeds, that are pointy at one end
and round at the other.

If you described that to a botanist or a gardener, they would tell you
immediately that it was probably a sunflower, but I didn't get any useful
results from searching by the description. In fact, none of the lists of UK
plants with hairy stems or alternate leaf-growth patterns that I did find
included the sunflower.

It wasn't until we could see the flower forming and looking very like a
sunflower that I could search for 'sunflower hairy stem' and get a
description telling me that sunflowers have long, hairy stems and leaves
growing alternately from the stem. Once I knew what I wanted, the machine
learning behind the search engine could tell me about it, but it couldn't
take my description and tell me what I was looking at.

For the past 20 years or so, many large companies have tried to match
candidates with positions by automatic processes to scan CV's for keywords;
this method may be faster, but may miss candidates who would do an excellent
job, but whose CV does not contain *exactly* the same keywords a manager had
to come up with to describe the job.

Thus, much of the interview process is already done by robots; however the
new method misses an even more important aspect: getting a candidate
acquainted with the people s/he's going to be working with.  (Though in this
case, the job's description seems to indicate that the newly hired employee
would be working mainly with robots anyway)

1. The theft of British Airways's customer payment card details in 2018 was
   widely reported, but it seems that the hackers also lost out due to the
   sudden abundance of saleable information reducing the black-market value
   of these details...

Summary follows.  The full article [not included] gives typical black-market
values for personal details; the title comes from a comment that “the
typical profile of cyber-crime victims are well-off, middle-aged
professionals aged 35-44 with an income above 50,000 pounds [$65,000] in
managerial positions.''

<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/09/10/rich-smart-sensibly-grown-up-hackers-dream/">https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/09/10/rich-smart-sensibly-grown-up-hackers-dream/</a>

Rich, smart and sensibly grown-up? You're the hackers? dream
Harry de Quetteville, 10 Sep 2019

Poor hackers. British Airways?s aircraft may be grounded again, but at least
this time the company knows why: its pilots are on strike.  Too often in
recent years the company has stranded passengers because of mysterious IT
foul-ups.

The cost of some of those failures was not always immediately apparent.
In 2018 half a million BA customers had their payment card details
stolen.

It was only later BA was hit was hit with a huge ?183m fine for the breach.
And it now turns out it wasn?t just BA and its passengers who suffered.
Hackers did too.

So many fraudulent cards hit the market after the data breach at BA (as well
as others at Marriott, and Ticketmaster) that black market prices collapsed.

2. RISKS often features the problems of the latest technology, but here's an
   item on the problems of *not* using this.  The UK's National Health
   Service (`the envy of the world') still uses fax machines, pagers,
   land-line telephones, etc. for communications, which are obviously not
   ideal for a large organisation dealing with a huge throughput of
   patients, especially as much information is time- and life-critical.
   Some staff unofficially use social networking sites like WhatsApp, but
   there are big RISKS here with patient confidentiality, possibility of
   confusion between personal and work information, no way of sorting
   incoming messages, and so forth.

Working in health is quite a high-pressure job in general of course, but if
it's difficult to make contact with other people this just raises stress
levels and wastes valuable time.  This article features a junior doctor,
Lydia Yarlott, who has come up with a fix (summary follows):

<a href="https://www.cityam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/CITYAM_20190910_NEW.pdf">https://www.cityam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/CITYAM_20190910_NEW.pdf</a>

&gt; With WhatsApp being seen as a sort of sticking plaster to the
&gt; communication problem, in true doctor fashion, Yarlott started concocting
&gt; a cure.  With the help of a team of technologists, she has built a secure
&gt; instant messaging service called Forward Health designed for doctors,
&gt; nurses, midwives, and other clinicians.  Through the app, NHS staff can
&gt; search by name or role in a hospital or clinic, share patient notes and
&gt; photos, with everyone working off the same list.  On average, the app
&gt; saves each clinician 43 minutes per shift, which is time that would
&gt; usually wasted waiting for a colleague to call them back.  It means that
&gt; doctors can access the info they need anywhere in the hospital, ultimately
&gt; allowing them to move away from paper notes.  It?s a simple idea, and
&gt; remarkable that nothing like this existed in the NHS already, which just
&gt; goes to show how far behind official hospital technology ? still heavily
&gt; reliant on pagers ? really is. And it?s worrying that old-fashioned and
&gt; counterintuitive tech is exacerbating existing issues in the NHS, making
&gt; the working lives of staff even harder.  While bringing NHS tech into the
&gt; modern era is vital, the organisation is such a vast and complex web that
&gt; updating the system is painfully difficult ? not to mention the fact that
&gt; [NHS] trusts tend to make standalone decisions, rather than learning from
&gt; each other.

A serious issue is [that] your phone's precious single USB socket is rated
for only a limited amount of plugging in and out, after which it will start
to fail (bad connection, not all metal plates properly in contact).

Meaning you won't be able to charge your phone anymore—spelling the
certain demise of your phone completely, as it would make more sense to get
a fast new phone rather than repair an old slow one.

Mom was right. See what happens after too much `phone s*x'.

“Avoid multiple partners'' they say.  Well even to much plugging in and out
'action' with the same partner will lead to `terminal' illness, as was my
experience with MicroUSB. And I'm not going to increase my `libido' and RISK
it with my new Type C phone. I'm just not in the mood, OK?

Re: "Bright Idea --Can't stop..." (<a href="https://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/31/41">RISKS-31.41</a>)

This raised some questions in my mind, so here is a little follow-up, from:
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/13/teen-smart-fridge-twitter-grounded">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/13/teen-smart-fridge-twitter-grounded</a>

"After reports emerged questioning Dorothy's account, LG confirmed that some
of its fridge models have social media capabilities, but the company could
not confirm whether Dorothy's tweet was sent from one.

“We don't know if Dorothy actually used an LG smart refrigerator to tweet,
but yes “ it is possible to access Twitter via the web browser on select LG
smart refrigerator models,'' an LG spokeswoman, Taryn Brucha, said.

Igor Brigadir, a computer researcher at University College Dublin, reviewed
the tweets for the Guardian and said that the metadata for Dorothy's Wii U
and Nintendo tweets showed that the tweets were legitimate. He said others
had used the devices to post on Twitter in the past.

But the refrigerator tweet, Brigadir said, most likely did not come from the
fridge. “The LG fridge [tweet] was definitely manually created,'' he said.

Brigadir examined the metadata of the tweets and discovered that they were
sent through a custom Twitter app. If Dorothy had tweeted from the fridge,
Brigadir continued, the metadata would probably have said the tweet was sent
through a browser, not from a fridge.

Dorothy was able to make it look like she tweeted from the fridge because
custom apps can be renamed on Twitter to make tweets appear as though they
were sent from different devices.

“For me, the think that seals it is the fact that nobody else ever made any
other tweets from that fridge, whereas, for the Wii U and Nintendo clients,
there's fresh tweets daily,'' Brigadir added.

  [Amos Shapir notes that this is rather old news—and probably fake:
