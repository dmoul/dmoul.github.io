Nancy, your mention of n-version programming in "Clarifications on the A320
Design" (recent RISKS) reminds me of an n-version failure I experienced last
year.

In the design of the Intel's 80960 microprocessor, we generated two simulators
for the instruction set.  The first emulated the programs at the instruction
level, and the second emulated programs at the logic/register-transfer level.
These two simulators were developed independently from a detailed architecture
specification.  A third group wrote an automatic test generator, used for
validating the hardware and simulators, which created self-checking programs
with "interesting" random operands and results.

All three implementations, both simulators and test generator, made the
same mistake with the modulo instruction.  The remainder instruction was
implemented correctly, but the modulo instruction did an extra subtraction
when the dividend and divisor had opposite signs and the dividend was an
exact multiple of the divisor.  (For example, 4 mod -4 returned 4, not 0.)
The test generator tested for these cases, but wrongly computed the
expected result in such a way that both the hardware logic and the test
generator produced exactly the same results.

This mistake was discovered well after a year of software development on
the processor by a user who was debugging an "impossible" condition.

Although this is the only explicit n-version failure we had, and even
though the n-version approach found on the order of ten thousand design
errors (estimated) over the course of the 5 year effort, this one failure
was a striking experience.  There were several more bugs that the
n-version programming probably didn't find, but they're more forgivable
because there even any tests generated for those sets of conditions.

For me, n-version programming is a valuable tool, but I wouldn't want
to rely entirely on it.

That is very interesting.  It would, of course, also be interesting to
determine whether the number of mistakes found by a different type of testing
technique would have been less, as, or more effective.  It is also possible
that more "common mode" failures exist, but that noone has discovered them yet
(the one you speak of was discovered, it sounds, by accident).

My student, Tim Shimeall, is just completing a dissertation in which one of the
topics is a comparison of back-to-back testing (n-version testing) vs. regular
testing.  Eight versions of a specification were written independently and then
the programs subjected to both back-to-back testing and regular testing.  Even
though the testers were undergraduate students and unskilled at testing (not
something usually taught to undergrads), the back-to-back testing was not
terribly effective in comparison to the other test methods used (structured
walkthroughs, automated static analysis, functional testing).  The problem is
that voting is not a very good test oracle — even on the same test cases,
voting did not find the same errors as standard testing techniques.  One of the
reasons is that voting could compare final results only and not look at
intermediate computations.  Often, the testing methods that could thoroughly
instrument a program detected errors that did not, for those particular input
cases, actually result in wrong answers.  Voting on intermediate results would
not have solved the problem.  The errors did not exist at the abstract function
level, but at a much finer level of granularity.  Any attempts to vote at this
level would have required that the specification include the exact algorithms
and variables to be used, thus defeating the whole purpose of writing multiple
versions and just moving the errors to the common specification.

We did find that the back-to-back testing detected errors that were not
detected by testing.  However, we cannot conclude much here because of the
inexperience of the students doing the standard testing.  We gave them a little
instruction, but none had ever used these test methods before.  This same type
of comparison should perhaps be done with more experienced testers.

Almost all n-version experiments are either done in isolation (without
comparing it to the alternatives in a controlled fashion) or have so many other
methods applied to the programs in conjunction with the n-version programming
that it is not possible to separate the effect of one method from the others.
The important question is not whether one method of detecting errors finds
some, but whether the alternatives that could have been used would have been
better, the same, or worse at finding errors and whether they find the same
errors or different ones (i.e., are alternative or complementary techniques).
There are obviously costs associated with all these error-detection techniques
and almost always a finite and limited amount of resources and time to apply
them.  The real question is how should these limited resources be spent.

No one has yet (including us) compared formal verification techniques with
some of these other approaches.  I just heard John Cullyer speak on the
VIPER development and proof and was very impressed.  My bias is to believe 
that formal techniques would be superior to many of these other techniques, 
but this needs to be confirmed using carefully controlled experimental 
comparison.  In lieu of this, it will be interesting to see if the VIPER 
turns out to have fewer design and other errors than similar microprocessors 
developed using non-formal techniques.

The only small piece of evidence that I know of was obtained during an 
experiment by Brunelle and Eckhardt in which they had two more versions
of the SIFT operating system (written at SRI using formal specification and
verification techniques although not, in the end, completely verified to
the code level) written by graduate students.  When the three versions
were run together as an n-version voting system, no errors were found in
SIFT but there were instances of the two unverified versions outvoting the
correct SIFT version.  The programmers may, however, have had vastly different
backgrounds and experience from the SRI programmer, so no real conclusions 
can be reached here.  But it is interesting.  Harlan Mills is also claiming
very substantial gains from the use of formal development procedures on real
projects at IBM.

&gt; CCI also cleverly placed the "reboot" switch, an up/down toggle, on the
&gt; front of the cabinet, not recessed, and at knee level...

Some years ago, when I was with CSRI here, we had an analogous problem.
The machine room was relatively long and narrow, and we had two multi-
rack systems facing each other with consoles in the space in between.
The beat-up old swivel chair that we used as a console chair had a rubber
bumper strip high on its back so it wouldn't mar a wall (or whatever) if
you leaned back against one.  Turned out that the bumper was at exactly the
height of the control switches on one of the RK05 disk drives.  Oops...
We changed console chairs.

I once bought a little container of Minced Garlic at the Food Gallery on
Centre Ave., Shadyside.  The shelf price was something like $1.89, I don't
really know.  The scanned price, however, was $5287.44.

I was with a bunch of my friends, all of whom were very very amused by this.
Unfortunately, the checkout clerk and the manager were both fairly humorless,
and didn't appreciate our comments.

  "Bad garlic crop this year?"
  "Gee, I better really enjoy this garlic bread tonight."
  "Do you take the American Express Gold Card?"
  "Only fifty-two hundred?  I'll take two."
  "Reaganomics."
  "Do you have change for a ten thousand?"
  "Hmm.  Garlic bread tonight, or a new car?"

All the original information for the last 5 digits of the NJ Drivers License
is correct (MMYYE) except for the omitted fact that 50 is added to the month
(MM) field for female drivers.  I used to think that this was to make it a
less recognizable date (for women, who tend to conceal their age sometimes),
but now guess it's just adding in a coding for sex also.

I can confirm that all the Watrouses I know have the same initial letter and
4 digits.  I'm curious as to how the middle 5 digits are arrived at.

In the first place, the great majority of burglars are low-ambition,
low-intelligence people.  In general, they are looking for a quick, easy hit
-- if they were interested in learning in a new skill, they'd most likely
get a safer, higher-paying job.  In the second place, why pick a lock when
you can kick a door in, smash a window, or try the neighbor's house with the
unlocked door?

  Randy Miller discussed the delights of lockpicking, and then raised some
questions.  He raised his chances of success by using inexpensive new locks.
The lower the precision of the lock, the less the chance of quick picking.
The BEST (brand) of locks is of standard construction (with regard to the
pins and cylinder) but is very well made, and is quite difficult to pick.
Then there are locks with specially designed pins (the Medeco brand is
particularly well known) which make sucessful picking unlikely.
Old/corroded locks are often difficult to work with.

  Most of his questions also apply to physical security of computing
facilities, and the concepts are even more general.

  Most locks (e.g., in homes) are not extremely pick resistant, and there
are perfectly good reasons why they are not.  It is a principle of security
that you should reinforce the weaknesses - and not waste time strengthening
the already strong areas.  (This also applies to computer security.)  Since
most (wood frame) doors, windows, desks, etc. are less resistant to force
than their locks are to picking, it would be a waste of money to buy better
quality locks.  (This principle also applies to computer security.)

&gt;     I called some city and state offices, and one local locksmith, to see
&gt;if there are any laws regulating the possession and use of lockpicks in
&gt;Arizona.  No one I talked to seemed to know anything about any regulations!

  There is a "risk" of asking the wrong question! Ask again about possession
of "burglar's tools"! (Yes, the definition of "burglar's tools" is context
dependent.)  It is not a good idea to have a lock pick in your pocket when
you are in or around someplace which has been burglarized!

&gt;     If it's so easy to pick open locks, why do burglars resort to harder and
&gt;messier ways of entering buildings, desks, cabinets, etc.?  Are most burglars
&gt;incapable of learning such a skill, or does it just not occur to them?

  It isn't so easy (you, a technical person, spent quite a bit of time
learning/practicing this.)  A 2' crowbar or strong screwdriver will usually
work faster, and with less practice needed - and who cares about "messier"?

&gt;Should I spend a fortune replacing the locks on my house, or are the risks
&gt;low that a burglar will pick the locks?

  If the easiest way to get into your house is by picking the lock(s), then
you probably should replace them.  Spring latch locks can also be defeated
by use of a piece of flexible plastic or metal - do you have dead bolts?

Picking a lock takes time, and sometimes even locksmiths can't do it quickly.
I remember being locked out of a condo at Lake Tahoe last year, and the
locksmith who was called out to open the place up spent 2 hours trying to
pick the lock.  Finally, he gave up and took out a hammer and chisel.  Just
two hits on the deadbolt were all that was needed to completely demolish it.
The door was open in about 10 seconds.  What really amazed me was how quickly
*anyone* can get into someone's home, just with a hammer and chisel.  Locks
only keep out honest people.

    I can provide a more modern example of "too silent" error
recovery.  A couple of years ago I was programming in Berkeley Smalltalk:
the implementation of Smalltalk on a Sun.  I was surprised at how slow
the graphics of the system was, and went in to tweak the virtual machine.
First, I "batched" the bitmap operations.

    Nothing happened.

    I put in a few print statements to see what was going on in there.

    Nothing happened.

    In desperation I put print statements all over the place.

    Finally, something happened - but not much.  The virtual machine
operation was returning an error immediately (this was "drawLoopXY" for
the curious).  Interpreted Smalltalk code was then taking control and
doing the drawing using more primitive calls.  In all its history,
Berkeley Smalltalk virtual machine had never actually drawn any lines!
The Smalltalk code was silently doing it all, at far less speed.

    I had thought this experience unique, until I saw the message
about DWIM.  I wonder how many of our "high-level programming environments"
are running much, much more slowly than they need to?

    One of the RISKS readers wrote in to register his surprise at the
concept of receipts for withdrawals and also for deposits, taking the more
traditional legal "exchange money for receipt" view.
    The ATMs here in Los Angelos give "receipts" for deposits,
withdrawals, transfers, and user-selected balance checks. The receipt for
deposits is the traditional legal-style notice that money has been received.
The "receipt" for the other transactions are hard-copy of the transaction,
and therefore not a receipt in the strictest sense. For instance, I find it
very worthwhile keepng the withdrawal 'receipts' from my checking account
ATM withdrawals: balanced checkbooks are happy checkbooks. Hardcopy balance
statements are handy for trying to figure out when checks cleared to contest
a bounced check, and an ATM transfer of funds needs a record just as much as
any other deposit does.
    And a deposit accepted without a receipt is a donation. No joking.
Even most organized charities give receipts for donations accepted.

    Rather "receipts" than mute ATMs! Joe Beckenbach
