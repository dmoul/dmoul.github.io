&gt;This raises interesting questions of authentication. Wouldn't it be possible
&gt;to add to air traffic messages some kind of ``signature'' that would help
&gt;receivers distinguish between legitimate and bogus messages?

If there were to be such a voice authentication system, the information would
need to be readily available to every pilot. This includes not only those who
fly for large commercial airlines, but to every private (even student) pilot.
Any pilot who might use air traffic control (ATC) facilities would need to
know this data, and there are several hundred thousand of them. In addition,
for the same reason that visual flight rules (VFR) pilots must carry
aeronautical charts for the area they fly in, they would need to have the
authentication codes for the whole area. (In an emergency, you might wind up
at ANY airport within the flying radius of your airplane, especially if that
emergency was because you weren't where you thought you were.)

If the information is that readily accessible, the bad guys can get it, too.

An additional concern is that the airport vicinity is often not the place
where you want to require from pilots the extra effort (or time) required to
look up authentication codes before they follow instructions.

Some of this problem may be solved by the use of digital printed data, which
are in use in some aircraft. This will not filter down to the private aircraft
for many years.

Fernando Pereira makes the suggestion of adding a ``signature'' to air traffic
control messages as a means of verifying their authenticity.  This is an
interesting suggestion.  The comments below relate primarily to the Air
Traffic Control (ATC) system in the US.

The present system of air-to-ground communication has two components: VHF
voice and UHF radar transponders.  Currently, aircraft flying under Instrument
Flight Rules (under which all air carriers and many supplemental carriers are
required to operate) carry a transponder which is capable of replying to a
radar sweep with a 12-bit identification code and its altitude.  This is
referred to as a ``Mode C'' transponder.  It would be very difficult to
construct an unspoofable authentication code for either of these systems.

The FAA has plans to upgrade to ``Mode S'' transponders, which would give ATC
a digital uplink capability.  This would make it easier to implement a
verification code, but I have no idea whether this issue has been discussed by
the FAA.

The original date for adoption of the Mode S standard was 1992, but there has
been quite a bit of slippage.  Mode S transponders will be much more
expensive, of course, and smaller aircraft (both personal and corporate) will
probably continue using Mode C transponders and voice communication for some
time.

&gt;1) The Telescript language is interpreted, rather than compiled. Thus,
&gt;Telescript programs cannot directly manipulate the memory, file system or

Don't forget: that's what we all thought about fingerd.  RTM, Jr. showed us to
be wrong.

And even ignoring bugs like this, interpreted vs compiled isn't the real
issue.  Postscript is typically interpreted, but since it has operators that
access files and can manipulate the interpreter's standard dictionaries, virii
can be implemented with it.

Some of the access control features described may prevent these kinds of
intrusions, but until we see more details I think we are be justified in being
concerned.

&gt;1) The Telescript language is interpreted, rather than compiled. Thus,
&gt;Telescript programs cannot directly manipulate the memory, file system or
&gt;other resources of the computers on which they execute.

This is a bit of a red-herring. Just because a language is interpreted by no
means implies that it cannot be used to produce worms/viruses. I have seen
viruses in Unix Shell scripts and even BASIC programs! IMHO it is *far* easier
for the average malicious idiot to produce a virus in a decent interpreted
scripting language than by hacking around with compiled executables.

The face that Telescript programs "cannot directly manipulate the
memory, file system or other resources of the computers on which they
execute" must be due to restrictions in the design of the language. They
have nothing to do with compiled vs interpreted programming. If an agent
has the capability to alter itself/other agents, it has to be
manipulating the memory etc of the computer it is executing on.

&gt;2) Every Telescript agent (i.e, Telescript program that can move around a
&gt;Telescript network) is uniquely identified by a telename. A telename
&gt;consists of two components: an authority which identifies the "owner" of
&gt;the agent (e.g., the Personal Communicator from which it originated) and
&gt;an identity which distinguishes that agent from any other agent of the
&gt;same authority. The authority component is cryptographically generated
&gt;and cannot be forged. [...]

I presume you are going to give some information on the algorithm used
for producing the unique "telename" so we can feel a little more sure
about the "cannot be forged" bit :-) Also, does the telename change for
self-modifying agents (if such things can be produced with Telescript?)

&gt;3) Every Telescript agent has a permit which limits its capabilities.
&gt;Permits can be used to protect users from misprogrammed agents (e.g., an
&gt;agent that would otherwise "run away" and consume resources for which the
&gt;user would have to pay) and to protect Telescript service providers from
&gt;malicious agents. [...]

I am presuming that "permits" (why not "telepermits" :-) are also encrypted in
some way to prevent naughty people producing agents which fib about what they
are allowed to do. Like Phil Agre, I too am "looking forward to the first few
reverse-engineered Telescript products"!

[Disclaimer: I have to admit my entire knowledge of Telescript comes from the
two RISKS articles I've read, so apologies for the picky tone.  To the peeps
at GM, I do find the concept of an agent scripting language fascinating, and
it's good to know that you are thinking about security issues.]

Since we all know that sh, BASIC, awk, perl and tcl are completely
free of security holes, we can know feel at ease knowing that, since
Telescript is interpreted, and thus cannot "directly manipulate the
memory, file system or other resources", Telescript is safe as houses.

Presumably the reason that C is less safe is that it can "directly
manipulate" [ sic ] the filesystem of a computer.

Pardon?  Since when has an interpreter been safer than a compiler?  Any
programming language capable of useful work is also capable of
destruction.  [this is known in our office as "Pages law of languages"
after John Page who says it repeatedly]

Valente the goes on to further document how cryptographic (presumably
public key) signatures are used to ensure secure and limited processing
of agents.

However the asserts that forged messages are impossible,  that is a
very brave thing to say in the light of the history of such statements.

Several questions spring to mind:

1) will the security be published and subject to external verification
(see all the arguments about clipper)?

2) will the security be downgraded for export, if so could a
compromised 'export' message run on domestic networks?

3) what is the vulnerability to social engineering?  As has been proven
people are always the weak link.

4) what provision will there be to stop re-chipped / 'tumbled' devices?

I for one would be far happier with some clear discussion of risk
rather than the classic "it can't happen response" we see so regularly
until it does happen.

The initial risk level from alien signals is very, very low.  Since the
hostile intelligences can not know the details of our computer systems,
writing any kind of virus would be very nearly impossible.  Indeed, achieving
any kind of communication would be (will be?) very difficult.  The few tests
that have been conducted so far involve one scientist composing a message
based on "universal" mathematical constants and relations.  Usually this
message is to be laid out in a square matrix, with stick figures of a human,
blobs for our solar system, etc.  Unfortunately, often other scientists can
not decipher the message.  Now consider that the intelligences trying to
decipher the message might be a squid living 20 miles down in a Jovial type
atmosphere.  Also note that it took humans 10K years or so to discover that by
using sign language they could communicate with monkeys.

Next, communication will take a LONG time.  Since we have been listening for a
few years now, it is reasonably certain that we have no technologically
advanced nearby neighbors, that is within 50 light years or so.  So our
hostile alien will have to guess the detailed operation of the computer(s) we
will be using 50 or 500 years in the future when his message gets here.

A certain amount of risk does exist.  If the aliens are very much more
intelligent that we are (possible with genetic engineering or more efficient
evolution) and we develop extensive communications with them (hoping for some
crumbs of their superior technology) then when they send a wonderful program
for us to run with root privilege....  A very much worst case is given in "A
Fire Upon the Deep" by Vernor Vinge where billions of worlds are destroyed by
hostile programs via the galactic equivalent of the internet.

The bottom line is, after we gain some reasonable level of communication with
the whatevers, be very wary of Greek gifts, and/or offers of alien waterfront
property.

Is this a reasonable assumption?  We've always sent "baby talk" messages, but
then again we've sent very short messages.  And we're barely a technological
civilization; we've had radio for a century, computers for half that.  Many
people living today were born before the first digital computer was built!

What about a society willing to run a sequence which contained a few terabytes
of information, starting from a simple binary raster image and progressing to
fractally compressed images (or an even more advanced technology) and possibly
even a DNA dump?  Can we really assume that SETI signals will be pure "data",
and not the equivalent of a 9 track containing uncompress.c in plaintext,
tar.c.Z, and then encyclopedia.tar.Z?

(This is not an idle thought; a while back someone posted a bogus "SETI"
signal to sci.crypt.  It contained a primer in digital logic and could have
easily been extended to give the specification for a computer.)

Several people have refuted the idea of SETI signals containing a virus, but
I'm not sure anyone has really explained *why* this isn't a problem.  At
least, I don't think there's been enough of an explanation for the lay-person
who's view of computers has been molded by one too many episodes of Star
Trek...

Viruses are computer programs.  Nothing more, nothing less.  The have the
property of being able to replicate themselves and, through crafty
programming, "infect" other computers.  What do I mean by "infect"?  Simply
that the programmer has found a tricky way for the program to get transferred
to another computer without the operator being aware.  This usually involves
the virus hiding itself somewhere on a disk or in another program.

Just like any other program, a virus must be run in order to be effective.
Obviously the operator won't knowingly run a viral program.  The virus's
programmer uses a trick of the particular computer to force the virus to be
run.  Say the virus attaches itself to another program.  It'll do this in such
a way that when the operator thinks he is starting the benign program, he's
actually starting the viral program.  This can be done with varying degrees of
sophistication, of course.  As another example, say the virus writes itself to
a boot disk.  The virus's programmer will typically make it install itself in
place of part of the operating system, so the virus is run instead of (or in
addition to) the computer booting.

So, the virus is just a program.  It must be run.  And, like any other
program, it can only be run on a particular brand of computer.  You can't run
Macintosh programs on an IBM, and you can't infect an IBM with Macintosh
viruses.  (We'll ignore emulation programs like SoftPC for the purposes of
this article.)  Viruses aren't effective until they're run.  You don't need to
worry about spreading viruses if you transfer data disks (say, word processing
or spreadsheet files) between computers.  Viruses aren't *DATA*, they're
*PROGRAMS*.

In order for a SETI virus to be effective it must be run as a program.  We're
not doing that with SETI signals now, and I doubt we ever will.  For one
thing, what sort of computer would we run the SETI program on?  I really doubt
the Little Green Men use IBM compatible computers!  Or any other sort we
commonly use here on Earth.  Even if there were a computer program (viral or
benign) contained in the SETI data we'd have no way to execute it without an
alien computer.  This is the real reason we're safe.  Even if the data stream
contains a viral program we'd need to run it in order for it to be effective.
And to run it we'd need the alien's computer.

Okay, let's say we have some *REALLY* malicious Little Green Men out there.
They've beamed up a 486 machine and have written a virus for it.  They send
the viral program down so our SETI antennas pick it up.  The researchers here
miraculously recognize 486 machine code in the data stream and run the
program.  Are we dead?  Well, hopefully if it comes to that one of our Heroic
Scientists will have the presence of mind to read the bloody code before they
run it!  Or at least, they'll run it on a machine that's not networked to
anything.  Of course, if the aliens are capable of this in the first place
they can probably do a lot worse to us than writing silly little computer
viruses.

Oh, that we really might have an opportunity to worry about picking up
anything at all with SETI, never mind programs containing viruses or Super
Mario Brothers 32767.

Didn't congress just cancel funding the latest and very great SETI project
that had only recently begun?

    [Yes, but various private sources are keeping it going.  PGN]

There is an assumption in this discussion that a virus received by SETI would
need a particular type of hardware to run (i.e. an electronic computer). It is
possible, however, that it could use the human brain instead. This could
happen either at an individual or a group level.

At the individual level, most people have experienced a persistent tune which,
once heard, almost forces them to hum it for some time afterwards. Imagine a
more powerful effect where hearing the tune hummed by someone else is enough
to propagate the effect.

At the group level, consider Communism.  From the number of countries which
have tried it, it is clearly an idea that sounds correct initially, even if
practical application proves less successful.  We are obviously spreading this
particular virus in TV and radio broadcasts which are spreading off into space
continuously.

There is also an assumption that a virus must be harmful. This is not
necessarily so — the only true characteristic of a virus is that it can only
reproduce by using its host and a virus which helps its host might be more
successful in some circumstances. In particular, if interstellar communication
is greatly helped by a virus, such a virus would be much more likely to be
received here than one which debilitates a civilization.

Although a computer virus passed through SETI seems unlikely, a human virus is
not.  If a book like the Bible, Dianetics, or Das Kapital were received, it
could cause enormous harm.  Instantly, large numbers of people (albeit
slightly loony people) would see it as important received knowledge, perhaps
even holy knowledge, and begin to act accordingly.

The defense is obvious.  We must beam copies of our most dangerous books into
space.  This will subvert and destroy alien societies before they have a
chance to do the same thing to us!

Also, we must evaluate the threat.  Government scientists should set to work
on developing the most "effective" stories possible, to see how dangerous they
can be.  Of course, this work would have to be extremely secret to prevent its
accidental release.

This in turn sounds similar to Piers Anthony's "Macroscope" in which the
recently-discovered-on-earth macron particle turns out to be a great
communications carrier, and supports a sort of intergalactic Usenet.  But most
of the channels are jammed by a brain virus: access the information and you go
nuts.

Probably a lesson there for us :-)

Some ideas about malicious agents within SETI data have been explored in depth
in science fiction.  One scenario goes like this: aliens send us terabytes of
scientific and engineering data, including plans for constructing wonderful
devices.  We construct those devices and deploy them massively.  The aliens
invade, and activate a trojan horse in the devices.  This plotline was used in
"The Ophiuchi Hotline" by John Varley.

There was a science fiction novel by astronomer Fred Hoyle called "A for
Andromeda" (and a sequel, "Andromeda Breakthrough"). In the story, a
SETI-like listening program detects signals from the Andromeda Galaxy.
These are eventually decoded into instructions for a computer and its
program. The computer is built, at which point it then builds an android
which becomes the protagonist. The rest of the story doesn't have much
bearing on the discussion, though.

... but taking a Star Trek TNG episode as an example (!), the scientists were
all too willing to find any way at all to run a genetically buried program on
their computer. Presumably a scientist would try to build an emulator to run
the opcodes. Are the SETI scientists sufficiently careful in their approach to
build an emulator that could not be subverted by the 'executable' it runs?
