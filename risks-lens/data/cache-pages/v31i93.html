</p>
<p>
”There must be a price to pay for misusing the Internet. New ‘norms’ of
behavior must be nourished. Bad behavior must be punished. Up to a point,
that's fine. But the commission never really explains how this is to
work. One practical problem is the difficulty in identifying the source of a
cyberattack.”
</p>
<p>
Environment drives evolution. Genomes react to environmental stimulus over
generations; they adapt enable survival. The Internet's predominate genome
suggests business governance is an ideal adaptation candidate.
</p>
<p>
Each data breach, computer malfunction, viral infection, botnet, bent or
malicious insider, and DDoS incurs at least inconvenience, threatens
business mortality, and routinely compromises personal privacy. Weak digital
hygiene, inadequate training, ineffective content controls, and professional
shirking contribute to these chronic conditions. Elevating and enforcing
business conduct standards has never been more urgent.
</p>
<p>
Classified data loss is vigorously prosecuted under Federal law
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/04/nyregion/cia-leak-wikileaks-trial-Joshua-Schulte.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/04/nyregion/cia-leak-wikileaks-trial-Joshua-Schulte.html</a>,

</p>
<p>
Businesses entrusted to manage customer data suffer public brand outrage
when bulk content is lost through negligence. However, business governance
teams and employees are inconstantly found liable in civil courts.
</p>
<p>
Cyber-liability insurance compensates organizations and customers when
justice determines necessity; usually, a settlement is reached before trial
commences. Repeat incidents elevate premiums, and insurers mandate enhanced
internal remediation to suppress recurrence. Despite repairs, comprehensive
efforts to harden infrastructure, train employees, and build resilient
processes appears ineffective given their industrial frequency.
</p>
<p>
Governance “skin in the game” can compel organizational behavior to
prioritize customer interests that include data protection and privacy
maintenance practices.
</p>
<p>
Privileges accompany corporate rank. Why not balance them with legally
enforceable penalties? Would legislation that establishes financial
penalties for business governance teams, including possible imprisonment,
accelerate effective digital hygiene hardening and operational deployment?
</p>
<p>
Enforcement practices can compel business compliance rigor. The Financial
crisis of 2007-2008 (see
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007-2008">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007-2008</a>) forced
revisions to the Investment Advisors Act of 1940. Regulations were
introduced that required financial advisors to put customer interests
first. Rule violators were disciplined. However, regulations have been
recently softened to favor business interests. (See
<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2019-89">https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2019-89</a> and
<a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/financial-planning/how-to-find-reliable-financial-advice/">https://www.consumerreports.org/financial-planning/how-to-find-reliable-financial-advice/</a>).
</p>
<p>
The Cyberspace Solarium Commission (<a href="https://www.solarium.gov/report">https://www.solarium.gov/report</a>) “urges
Congress to give the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)
significantly more resources and additional authorities as the agency works
to ensure critical networks can recover quickly from cyberattacks and serves
as the ‘central coordinating element to support and integrate federal, state
and local, and private-sector cybersecurity efforts.’” This recovery
mechanism can facilitate post-attack remediation, but does not expedite
proactive and effective deterrence by Internet-based businesses.
</p>
<p>
Establishing a fair, reliable, and vigilant Internet “cop on the beat,”
funded in part from commercial and government data breach/malware fines,
could motivate a fundamental change in how Internet-dependent businesses
operate custodial data management practices. It is difficult to estimate
business enforcement expenses. Operational expenses are usually factored
into product prices. Consumers may experience certain pocketbook impact.
</p>
<p>
For Internet business models that advertise application access as a quid pro
quo for consumer data, there's likely very small revenue impact.  Other
industrial sectors: power distribution, healthcare, chemical, transportation
etc. may need to proactively pool revenue (or self-insure).
</p>
<p>
Government agency executives and employees should be subject to these
regulations. They are in business to safeguard public interests, which
includes oversight of significant personal identifying information and
commercial data.
</p>
<p>
Mandatory penalties derived from data loss or malware incidents would
effectively serve as an “Internet Tax” chartered by government to offset
materialized business risks that burden public confidence. A
politically-independent, enforceable regulatory structure is necessary to
restore the Internet's balance toward public interest.

“Let's say the President is tweeting out conspiracy theories about Joe
Scarborough,” Khanna said, referring to Trump's tweets earlier this week
about an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory regarding the death of an aide
that worked for the former Florida congressman.
</p>
<p>
“Well why not allow the widower who doesn't want the president tweeting
about his deceased wife, why not give him the opportunity to send a response
and that response Twitter could send to every person who clicks on the
President's tweets?” Khanna suggested.
</p>
<p>
“Or why not allow someone to respond to the President's claims about ballot
fraud?”
</p>
<p>
“What I would say is, you defeat speech with speech. But you didn't give one
person a huge megaphone and not allow a fair response,” he added.
</p>
<p>
In 1987, under President Reagan, the Fairness Act was abolished. An updated
Fairness Act, tabled for legislative debate, appears overdue.
</p>
<p>
If Khanna's solution is adopted, tag-tweeted publication latency accrues
until rebuttal content materializes. A timer might be established to
incentivize response. The tag-tweet process appears to be viable when
applied to a single political office.
</p>
<p>
The labor expense to oversee political content might become significant if
the resuscitated Act applied to all levels of government (federal, state,
local).
</p>
<p>
Should a media company be required to sponsor this activity as a public
service? Who pays for the speech/rebuttal oversight process? Who defines the
rules governing the speech/rebuttal process? Who arbitrates disputes over
what is/is-not political speech?

<p>
In some cities like Minneapolis, though, officials are starting to turn to a
familiar tool to investigate networks of protestors. The tool is
contact-tracing, and it's a familiar tool in that people have been hearing
about it frequently in recent weeks as an important component of a
comprehensive coronavirus pandemic response. According to Minnesota Public
Safety Commissioner John Harringon, officials there have been using what
they describe, without going into much detail, as contact-tracing in order
to build out a picture of protestor affiliations ” a process that
officials in the state say has led them to conclude that much of the protest
activity there is being fueled by people from outside coming in.

The now-patched vulnerability could have allowed remote attackers to bypass
authentication and take over targeted users' accounts on third-party
services and apps that have been registered using ‘Sign in with Apple’
option.

PRIVACY AND THE PANDEMIC (<a href="https://epic.org/events/June3/">https://epic.org/events/June3/</a>)
3 JUNE 2020, 1 PM - 2 PM EDT
</p>
<p>
The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health emergency of unprecedented scale,
and countries are deploying a wide range of techniques to respond. EPIC is
advocating for greater privacy protection to ensure that the public health
response protects individuals. These systems should be lawful and
voluntary. There should be minimal collection of personally identifiable
information. The techniques should be robust, scalable, and provable. And
they should only be used during the pandemic emergency.
</p>
<p>
Our panelists will discuss ways in which governments can protect both public
health and privacy, the technology behind digital contact tracing apps, and
the Congressional response to privacy and the pandemic.

<p>
Today the data suggests that we are near the beginning of a chaotic mess of
global proportions.  Things are fairly simple: a global pandemic with no
tools to fight the virus, a global economy in disarray, climate change and
other existential risks beginning to intrude into our daily lives, and a
total lack of a plan as to what to do.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, we are at the pinnacle of human capabilities and have, if
we so choose, the capability to create a Utopian egalitarian world without
conflict or want.
</p>
<p>
In this 2-hour program, a group of experts will explore the future, focusing
on 2030 and 2050.
</p>
<p>
Where are we now?  What is trending?  What if anything can be done about it?

</blockquote>
<p>
Abstract: This article provides an overview of intimate threats: a class of
privacy threats that can arise within our families, romantic partnerships,
close friendships, and caregiving relationships. Many common assumptions
about privacy are upended in the context of these relationships, and many
otherwise effective protective measures fail when applied to intimate
threats. Those closest to us know the answers to our secret questions, have
access to our devices, and can exercise coercive power over us. We survey a
range of intimate relationships and describe their common features.  Based
on these features, we explore implications for both technical privacy design
and policy, and offer design recommendations for ameliorating intimate
privacy risks.

<p class="pre">
&gt; How long will it be before we see: “iPhone app bug allows anyone to lock
&gt; Tesla owners into their cars”?
</p>
<p>
Never, I suspect.  When I saw the original report in 31.87 I was suspect in
that Teslas don't have a “remote off” and there is no physical locking
mechanism.  All “locking” the car does is tell the car to ignore the
exterior door handle microswitches.  Attempting to duplicate this on my own
Tesla Model 3, the interior driver door button always obeyed, but even if I
locked it with my phone, and on top of that, there's the mechanical door
release which bypasses the electronic lock.  And the mechanical release is
most like all other vehicle door releases, and is used often by passengers
unfamiliar with the vehicle.
</p>
<p>
I suspect this was a case of someone not knowing how to deal with the
differences of how to operate the vehicle.  The car has a non-standard way
of shifting into drive modes, and will not shift into drive mode without
without detecting the phone key/keyfob inside the vehicle.  I suspect the
carjacker was confused enough for the owner to get out of phone Bluetooth
range, and was too impaired to deal with what to do next.

&gt; “Think about all of the servers that are stored around the world that
hold repositories of this code. The only way the Arctic vault would be
useful is if the entire human civilization was essentially wiped out”
</p>
<p>
That's what Mersk had thought, before all their servers were hit by NotPetya
at once; they were saved only by a server in Ghana which happened to be
offline at the time.
</p>
<p>
The point is, it's not unthinkable that all repositories which belong to the
same owner, or relate to the same subject, or contain some specific
information, are hit at the same time by a carefully directed attack.

<p>
&gt;Losing your 2FA codes can be bad. Having backups stolen can be worse. What
 to do?
</p>
<p>
My, what a gratuitous mess. The TOTP codes used by 2FA apps are in fact
base32 character strings to be hashed with a timestamp to produce the
six-digit codes used for authentication. The QR codes also contain the name
of the service and sometimes an image of its logo, but the base32 string is
all that matters. Whenever something shows you the QR code, there is
invariably a way to get it to show you the string, in case you can't scan
the QR code, and the apps have a way to enter the string manually.
</p>
<p>
Keeping this in mind I can suggest a variety of lowish-tech ways to avoid
losing your TOTP strings:
</p>
<p>
Scan them into more than one app when you get them.
</p>
<p>
Scan them into apps on more than one device. I use my phone, my tablet, and
a python script on my laptop.
</p>
<p>
Put the strings in a file on a device you leave at home, perhaps a USB stick
in a drawer. Print the strings out on a piece of paper and put it in your
wallet, with hints that make sense to you about which string goes with which
service. (The hints and the strings need not be in the same order so long as
you remember the mapping.)
</p>
<p>
It would take an extremely unusual bad guy to first steal your wallet and
then figure out what the scribbles on the paper mean.  On the other hand if
you lose your phone, you can enter the strings into an app on your new phone
by hand and you're ready to go.

This awesome news about Vitamin C is breaking as we …. oh, wait! 71 years
old, next month. Clearly it was ignored if not anathematized as impossible
by the medical establishment. (I am reminded of heliobacter pylori being
‘unpossible’.)
</p>
<p>
Dr. Klenner got amazing results against all sorts of viral diseases. The
results point to the importance of a healthy immune system as the first line
of defence.
</p>
<p>
Interesting to see that the bureaucracy was already in full force and power
back in 1949:
</p>
<p>
(3) Routine lumbar puncture would have made it obligatory to report each
case as diagnosed to the health authorities. This would have deprived myself
of valuable clinical material and the patients of most valuable therapy,
since they would have been removed to a receiving center in a nearby town.
</p>
<p>
I had to use some web-fu: 1000 mg of Vitamin C is 20,000 IU. So these
were not small doses and delivery seemed to require injection to be useful.
</p>
<p>
Interesting that it works on shingles.
Thanks to Andre Carezia for finding this and passing it on.
