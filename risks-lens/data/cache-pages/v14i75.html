 SUN MICROSYSTEMS INC KNOWS WHY BRAZIL IS KNOWN TO ITS NATIVE INHABITANTS
 AS THE KINGDOM OF THE ANTS

  Computergram via First! â€” Sun Microsystems Inc knows why Brazil is known
to its native inhabitants as the kingdom of the ants - it got an electronic
mail message from its local representative down there asking how to get rid
of bugs - ants nests to be precise: seems a user had turned his workstation
off for a few days and on returning to power the thing up was greeted by
some nasty crunching and popping sounds; opening the lid he was greeted by
an army of ants whose nest-building had been rudely interrupted by his
machine's Sparc CPU and disk subsystem coming to life; pest control was
hurriedly dispatched and the system was soon up and running - Sun knows its
stuff when it comes to bug-fixing.

Recently I have been working with the "World Wide Web," a project
designed to unite the various data resources on the internet into
a common web of information.  The Web began a few years ago at
CERN.  I am working at CERN as well, and some people who saw my
work or articles thought I was an official web project member.

So, on my 'signature' page ( <a href="http://info.cern.ch/roeber/fgmr.html">http://info.cern.ch/roeber/fgmr.html</a> )
I included a disclaimer:

  Please note: &lt;b&gt;I am &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; an official member ...&lt;/b&gt;.

The lingua franca of the web is HTML, or hypertext markup language, which is
based on SGML.  The codes in angle brackets above are SGML, and stand for bold
and italics.

I looked at my page with my whiz-bang X-based web browser (NCSA Mosaic), and
sure enough the line appeared with nice bold and italicised words.

A short time later, I got a call from a somewhat annoyed web project guy,
demanding to know why I was claiming to be an offical member.  It seems that
on his NeXT browser, the word "not" was mysteriously absent.

The problem was that his browser didn't support italics.

Why?  Well, when the Web began it was "hypertext" based.  Everything was
supposed to be simple, plain text accessible by everybody.  Though HTML was
based on SGML, this was more to be "standard" than to support fancy markups.
The core team had a nice plan as to how they would expand, slowly and in step.
Then the NCSA came along, with their elegant multimedia X-based browser.
Suddenly the web became "hypermedia," and (as it supported much more of SGML),
even plain text could be marked up in much fancier ways.  So people started
writing documents depending on the capabilities of NCSA Mosaic, leaving the
earlier browsers behind.  In this case, that lapse changed the entire meaning
of a rather important sentence.

There are a few points here:

  1) In important sentences of electronic documents, don't put
     important words (like "not") in other fonts or representations.

  2) In fact, avoid needless font and representation twiddling.

  3) Don't assume everybody has the same advanced tools you do.

  4) If you're going to use a standard, use *all* of the standard.
     HTML is based on SGML.  The &lt;i&gt; code is legitimate SGML.

  5) If you can't represent a requested font, for pete's sake don't
     just ignore the text!  Put it up however you can.  In this
     case, when I protested my innocence, the other guy loaded up
     the page on the old line-mode browser on the VM system.  This
     browser ignores virtually all markup commands, so the unadorned
     sentence â€” including the 'not' â€” appeared.

  6) If you launch a project in to the public, be prepared for
     someone to take the ball and outrun you.  You can't stay
     firmly in control.  This emphasizes point 4 â€” the whole point of
     "standards" is so that when this happens, things are still compatible.

I have been handling some of my elderly mother's bills after her recent
hospitalization. Since she is in an HMO (Health Maintenance Organization), she
should not have had any bills other than for personal incidentals (tv, etc.).
Yet, she kept getting bills from one medical testing lab.  When I made an
inquiry, the lab told me that the bills should have been paid by the HMO and
that I should notify them, which I did.  Several more bills came from the lab
and several more inquiry calls were made.  Yesterday, a letter came indicating
that the account is delinquent and that it will be turned over to a collection
agency unless paid immediately.  I called and was told that their records
indicated that the bill had not been paid.  After pushing them a lot to review
their records, they suddenly discovered that the bill had been paid by the HMO
s more than a month ago.  The clerk told me that there had been a *number of
cases* recently where the computer had not recognized that a payment had been
made and bills were automatically sent out.  He told me that the computer
problem ws being worked on.  When I complained that the lab continued to send
out bills even though they knew that some of them were false, he told me that
all people had to do was to call the accounts department (it was an 800
number) and any errors would be corrected.  However, if I had not insisted
several times that the HMO had been notified and that they had paid the bill,
the money would be owed by my mother.

The end result is that this lab knows that there is a billing problem and they
have continued to send out bills, some of which are erroneous.  Their solution
is that (often ill) people will know that the bill has been paid, will contact
the billing office, will fight to ensure that the correct information is in
the computer, and all will be resolved.  Unfortunately, what will really
happen is that some people will pay the bill even if they do not owe the money
and others will have their credit history threatened if they cannot afford to
pay the money.

While this does not seem to fall under the legal definition of fraud, it may
be illegal if the lab is billing with knowledge of a computer problem of this
sort.  I suspect that this problem is more common than recognized and that the
lab is only one of a number of organizations that have decided that orderly
processing of accounts is more important than correct billing of people.
Computer glitch has become an excuse for financial manipulation and harming of
people.

              PRELIMINARY AGENDA
       5th Computer Security Incident Handling Workshop
Sponsored by the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST)

              August 10-13, 1993
                St. Louis, MO


TUESDAY, August 10, 1993  Full-day Tutorials

1.  Creating a Security Policy, presented by Charles Cresson Wood:
      [no abstract available at time of posting]

2.  Vulnerabilities of the IBM PC Architecture: Virus, Worms, Trojan
      Horses, and Things That Go Bump In The Night
    presented by A. Padgett Peterson:

  An intensive look into the architecture of the IBM-PC and MS/PC-DOS --
  What it is and why it was designed that way. An understanding of
  assembly language and the interrupt structure of the Intel 80x86
  processor is helpful.

  The day will begin with the BIOS and what makes the PC a fully
  functional computer before any higher operating system is introduced.
  Next will be a discussion of the various operating systems, what they
  add and what is masked. Finally, the role and effects of the PC and
  various LAN configurations (peer-peer and client server) will be
  examined with emphasis on the potential protection afforded by login
  scripting and RIGHTS.

  At each step, vulnerabilities will be examined and demonstrations made
  of how malicious software exploits them. Demonstrations may include
  STONED, MICHELANGELO, AZUSA, FORM, JERUSALEM, SUNDAY, 4096, and EXEBUG
  viruses depending on time and equipment available.

  On completion attendees will understand the vulnerabilities and how to
  detect attempted exploitation using simple tools included with DOS
  such as DEBUG and MEM.

3.  Unix Security
    presented by Matt Bishop:

  Unix can be a secure operating system if the appropriate controls and
  tools are used.  However, it is difficult for even experienced system
  administrators to know all the appropriate controls to use.  This
  tutorial covers the most important aspects of Unix security
  administration, including internal and external controls, useful
  tools, and administration techniques to develop better security.

  Upon completion, Unix system administrators will have a better understanding
  of vulnerabilities in Unix, and of methods to protect their systems.
