From the Honolulu Star-Bulletin's "Streetwise" column, 27 April 1992:

Time change leaves stoplights out of sync (By David Oshiro)

Here's a story on how the clever machines that run our lives are sometimes too
clever.

Three weeks ago, most of the mainland switched to daylight savings time.
Unbeknown to city transportation officials here, a microchip controlling
traffic signals on Kalanianaole Highway contained a program written on the
mainland that contained an automatic conversion to daylight-saving [sic] time.

So, *voila*!  On Monday, April 6, the timing for peak traffic hours kicked in
an hour earlier, throwing signals off.  Signals that were changing in
200-second cycles began to change in 185-second cycles.

It was only a 15-second difference, and it only lasted an hour, but that was
enough to mess up morning rush-hour traffic [which is pretty bad on this
highway].

City workers, however, were able to figure out the problem and fix it that day.

A city transportation official said that there was no easy way to test that
chip in advance, to see it [sic] would have worked properly when the switch to
daylight-saving time occurred.

<pre>
This past week I was at a Microsoft Technical Seminar (read "boasting session")
and saw an interesting promotional piece.  Although longer than a normal ad, I
suspect it is planned to use the "playlet" for some kind of media presentation.
The "plot" is that Microsoft's Excel spreadsheet is so easy to use, and has so
many "labour saving" features that two dolts who have forgotten to put together
their presentation are able to do so in a one minute elevator ride to
"executive territory".

Other than stylistic aids, the primary function promoted is an "extension"
function which will "forecast trends".  With so much spreadsheet use being
devoted to business plans and cash flow projections, the attraction of such a
function is obvious.

However, the ad immediately triggered an alarm.  The feature is introduced, in
the ad, by the fact that the executive "wants to see ten percent growth".  The
original figure is $1000, so the user fills in the next column as $1100.  No
problem.  Then the extension feature is brought into play, and I mentally
follow along with the arithmetic.  The next column should say $1210.  But the
spreadsheet fills in $1200.  The fourth column should be $1331, but instead is
filled in as $1300.  Ah, to the numerate person, the reason is obvious: the
function is not a geometric "ten percent growth" but an arithmetic adding of an
additional hundred dollars each time.

To the numerate person, obvious.  To the general public?  How many of the
"average" business computer users would even notice?

The RISK of this particular choice of "extension" algorithm might not be all
that important.  However, it points out the increasing addition of "aids" in
computerized systems, and the need to note carefully the use that the using
audience is likely to put those aids to.  Business computer users, in my
experience, tend to want to think in "percentage" figures (eg. annual growth).
A simple "adding" function for forecasting will not give them the "correct"
answer appropriate to their mental model.

Small though this RISK might be in this instance, we have seen this same
principal at work in situations with much higher stakes.

The 20 April 1992 issue of DM News, a direct marketing trade publication,
reports that within the past two weeks, Metromail and Donnelly Marketing (two
of the very largest mailing list companies) were approached by the FBI which is
seeking mailing lists for use in investigations.  Other mailing list firms also
received feelers according to the story. "Neither of the identified firms would
discuss details, but one source familiar with the effort said the FBI
apparently is seeking access to a compiled consumer database for investigatory
uses."

"The FBI agents showed 'detailed awareness' of the products they were seeking,
and claimed to have already worked with several mailing list companies,
according to the source."

Metromail, according to the article, has been supplying the FBI with its
MetroNet address lookup service for two years.  The FBI said that the database
is used to confirm addresses of people the FBI needs to locate for an
interview.

This marks the first time since the IRS tried to buy mailing lists in 1984 that
a government agency has attempted to use mailing lists for enforcement
purposes.

In a separate but related story in the April 24 issue of the Friday Report, a
direct marketing newsletter, the RBOC's are teaming up with other firms to
develop white page directories on CD-ROM.  For example, US West has a joint
venture with PhoneDisc USA of Marblehead, Ma.  The article states that the
company offers lists failing mailing list enhancements to law enforcement
agencies.  [NOTE: an enhanced list means the names and addresses were matched
with a marketing database and additional demographic information was added to
the list from the marketing database].

&gt;Are call loggers a problem when you give your password to a mail retreival
&gt;system form a hotel or an office.  Is there a hacker market for this info?
&gt;Finally how prevelant is this problem in various parts of the world?

Many hotels detail your phone bill and include the phone numbers you called
during your stay.  How often does the hotel phone system capture your
MCI/Sprint/AT&amp;T calling-card number (which you touch-toned into the MCI,
Sprint, or AT&amp;T computer), too?

I can easily change the PIN on my voice-mail system; changing the PIN on my
calling card requires a call to the long-distance carrier, and possibly a new
card - something the long-distance carrier isn't going to want to do too often.

I had the same experience myself recently.  But, in addition to instructions,
it was also a telemarketing call by the local carrier!  Since I use my cellular
phone as a contact line for technical support and am always expecting calls (I
subscribe to a nationwide switching service), I was rather angry that they used
my time on the line like that.  Especially since it was during a driving
rainstorm while I was on the Interstate in the hills of northern Kentucky!  I
called *611 and told the person on the line to get me off whatever list I was
on to get this unnecessary greeting and unwanted telemarketing.  I haven't been
bothered since, but I don't know if my call got me off any "list".

Not only *could* the cellular phone company track one's movement "all over the
country" (although with great difficulty and expense using today's switches),
it is an active industry goal for the next generation of technology.  "Call
Delivery" — making your phone ring when someone dials your number, regardless
of your geographic location and serving carrier of the moment — is an integral
part of the standard being developed for interswitch communication (EIA/TIA
IS-41).  It is also seen as a key to making Personal Communication Networks
(PCN) work.

What happened to you in Georgia is the result of a feature known as "autonomous
registration", by which the serving switch instructs a mobile unit to register
(i.e. transmit its identity information including mobile phone number and
serial number) as soon as radio contact is established (as indicated on the
mobile's handset display by the "service light" or "service bars").  When the
system detected you were a roamer, it placed a call to your phone and played
the recorded greeting for your edification (although I don't know BellSouth's
policy, it is quite unlikely you were charged for this call).

Furthermore, Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) services are also seen as highly
desirable by a significant subgroup of wireless communication users (truckers
and victims of car thieves come immediately to mind).  There are companies that
claim to be able to determine the position of a mobile unit in a cell site to
within 100 feet using only the received 800 MHz radio signal, but the
technology is unreliable and expensive.  The more popular solution is to marry
a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver to a cellular phone or other
wireless terminal, but this is both proprietary and also expensive.

As long as the user retains the ability to "disappear" by turning the phone
off, I see the benefit as outweighing the risk in this form of network
tracking.  I squirm a lot more when I read about "beacons" placed in every car
for automatic toll collection and vehicle monitoring, because these specialized
systems exist solely for the purpose of tracking and accounting (NOTE: does
anyone really expect there to be an "off" switch on such a device?).  It's one
thing to choose to be tracked, and quite another to have an "Eye in the Sky"
checking up on you...

                  COMPASS '92  June 15-18, 1992
                      About the Conference

COMPASS is an acronym formed from COMPuter ASSurance, the subject of this
conference, the seventh of a series that began with COMPASS '86. According to
its charter, "The purpose of COMPASS is to advance the theory and practice of
critical systems through the medium of scientific and engineering meetings and
publications. The organization, under the IEEE, is dedicated to the study of
critical systems, especially those using digital computers or other new
technologies."

Critical systems are defined as systems whose failure could cause injury, loss
of life, or significant property loss or damage. Such failures may be failures
of commission, doing what should not be done, or of omission, not doing what
should be done. Critical systems have failed in the past. Radiation therapy
machines have killed cancer patients; industrial robots have killed workers;
spacecraft have been destroyed; and, hackers have vandalized and/or stolen from
information systems. The goal of COMPASS is to find and publicize ways to
prevent unacceptable failures of critical systems.

COMPASS expresses the idea of "Pointing the Way" and of "encompassing" many
technologies and technical disciplines. The logo, a variation of yin-yang
overlaying a compass rose, symbolizes both of these ideas.

COMPASS '92 has adopted the slogan "Building The Right System, Right." This
expresses the need for the developers of critical systems to rigorously define
the right requirements and ensure that they are satisfied, resulting in systems
that function as intended.

The sponsors and organizers of COMPASS encourage you to participate in future
COMPASS activities. Contact any member of the conference committee or the
conference board for more information.

COMPASS '92, Monday, 15 June 1992

9:00 a.m.  Tutorial 1: "Approaches to Developing Safety-Critical Software"

  Stephen S. Cha, Charles H. Lavine, and Jeffery C. Thomas, Aerospace
  Corporation, El Segundo, Ca.

  This tutorial surveys various software safety techniques proposed in
  literature or currently in practice. Following an introduction to software
  safety concepts, several industrial software development examples will be
  examined. The tutorial concludes with a discussion on formal methods and
  future research directions.

12:45 p.m.     Lunch

2:00 p.m.      Tutorial 2: "Interlocks-A Safety Engineering Tool"

  Phil Sedgwick, Control Systems Analysis, Newport, RI

  This tutorial introduces INTERLOCKS, a methodology and PC-based tool, that
  graphically describes and simulates the operation of computer system
  controls.  INTERLOCKS, in use by the DoD, employs a graphic language familiar
  to hardware and software engineers-simple AND and OR logic. The result for
  safety engineers is an INTERLOCKS network that models and simulates the
  hardware, software, and operator events that are prerequisite to critical
  function initiation.
