  [Please pass the word on to any of your friends and colleagues who would
  normally be reading RISKS via the UK redistribution on catless.ncl.ac.uk,
  courtesy of Lindsay Marshall.  Lindsay noted to me that catless was on a
  very old Newcastle server, and presumably will be rebootedâ€”eventually.
  Lindsay has been our heroic maintainer of the risks.org RISKS repository
  and its redistribution of RISKS issues to the UK for years and years.
  However, this outage is way beyond his responsibility, and is agonizing.
  Meanwhile, you can read RISKS as comp.risks or at risks@ftp.sri.com.  PGN]

room has always been deep underground."]

The Philippines' Commission on Elections' entire database of of 55-million
Philippine voters was breached, initially on 27 Mar 2016.

Trend Micro reported it on 6 Apr, with subsequent items in *The Register*
and *The Guardian*.  *The New York Times* reported it on 22 Apr.

"This incident clearly erodes the confidence of citizens in a of government
bodies. Some citizens might decide to never provide data again to the
Instituto Nacional Electoral, the next time their ID expires," Guzman adds,
noting that although it's a relief that financial and bank information were
not leaked, "the information could still be used for criminal purposes, since
the location[s] of citizens are available."

   * * *

With this leak, Mexico now joins a list of countries where almost the entire
population has had their personal information leaked or breached, as 93.4
million represents over 72% of Mexico's estimated population.  Belize,
Greece, Israel, Philippines, and Turkey have also experienced leaks of the
majority of their population's personal information. And of course, let's
not forget that Chris Vickery had also discovered 191 million U.S. voters --
data leaking due to a similarly misconfigured database.

Lead editorial, *The New York Times*, 25 Apr 2016, relating to Virginia
Governor Terry McAuliffe restoring voting rights to more than 200,000 people
who have completed their sentences for felony convictions.  This reverses
Virginia's previous lifetime ban on voting.  [PGN-ed]

  Final paragraph: Congress should amend the Voting Rights Act to restore
  preclearance and apply it to all jurisdictions with a recent history of
  discriminatory voting practices.  And state officials who are not busy
  trying to disenfranchise people should be following Mr McAuliffe's
  example, and working to make it easier for people to vote.

The E.U.'s Dangerous Data Rules
Op-Ed, *The New York Times*, 25 Apr 2016

Can Europe protect privacy without creating *splinternets*?

Important op-ed.  Here's the final paragraph:

Privacy is a real issue, and shouldn't be ignored in the Internet age.  But
applying those national laws to the Internet needs to be handled with more
nuance and concern.  These developments should not be driven only by privacy
regulators.  State departments, trade and justice ministries and telecom
regulators in France and other European countries should be demanding a
place at the table.  So should free-expression advocates.  One day,
international agreements may sort this all out.  But we shouldn't Balkanize
the Internet in the meantime.  Once we've erected barriers online, we might
not be able to tear them down.

FBI admits it paid $1.3m to hack into San Bernardino shooter's iPhone

The FBI paid about $1.3m for software to hack into the iPhone of San
Bernardino gunman Syed Farook, director James Comey told a London audience
on Thursday.

The staggering price illustrates the growth of the so-called "exploit
market" for digital spy tools and cyber weapons as governments increasingly
use hacker tricks for law enforcement and war.  Prices for such software are
rarely disclosed, although anything in the seven-figure range is extremely
expensive.

<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/21/fbi-apple-iphone-hack-san-bernardino-price-paid">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/21/fbi-apple-iphone-hack-san-bernardino-price-paid</a>

  [Yes, the alleged cost is staggering, However, perhaps the FBI is
  including all sorts of secondary costs, or having paid multiple sources
  for multiple exploits, or simply not understanding that the vulnerability
  that they actually exploited was well known in various communities, and
  could have have been acquired for free from certain sources!  PGN]

In short, a bug bounty hunter (someone looking to find bugs to take
advantage of a reward program) was examining Facebook and eventually found a
way in, only to discover that someone was already in the specific system.
Facebook proclaimed this to be residue left by another bounty hunter (making
the later one a hunter-gatherer?), a statement I have some problems with as
I personally would clear out malware as fast I'd discover it.

The story is summarised here, including a link to the rather interesting
writeup of the technical details:

According to Ann Christy, scammers are gaming the Amazon Kindle Unlimited
system by publishing fake books with many pages, and tricking people into
downloading them because:

1. They are free to download during the first five days of publication, and

2. They use click farms to force the books to the top of the Kindle
   Unlimited bestseller list.

The books themselves encourage the reader to go to the last page of the book
to be entered into a contest or some such. This causes Amazon to believe
that the entire book was read and results in a maximum payout to the
scammer. (Authors earn royalties on Kindle Unlimited books based on the
number of pages readâ€”apparently as measured by the last page read.)
Since the Kindle Unlimited royalty pool is fixed across all books this means
that authors of legitimate books are getting less than they should because
the scammers are taking thousands of dollars out of the pool.

Erm... no. Reading the article, it's clear that it wasn't the service that
led to the traffic violation, it was *the journalist blindly following the
satnav* that did it.  It would've resulted in a (almost) ticket, regardless
of whether this happened in a shared Beamer or the author's private Ford.

There is a RISKS lesson here, certainly, but it's an old one and it has
nothing to do with ReachNow specifically: when you turn on your satnav, do
not turn off your brain.

  [Fin: Uh...and just whose rating would that be? I can hand out stars, too,
  and will be more than happy to if you send me the names of the
  institutions. - Fin]

fin@nym.hush.com asked a question about what rating system I was using for
the due diligence, in my "Bank Back stabbing" post, for which I plan
additional future installments, after I have cooled down enough from my
anger with recent incidents, to describe with clarity and conciseness, to
best of my ability.

In the USA, banks are regulated by the FDIC government organization, which
awards stars for a variety of adherence to best practices and level of risk
of default, such as having enough money to sustain obligations, diversity of
investments across different industry sectors . what we laymen call SAFE and
SECURE, from both a financial perspective and a cyber perspective.  One star
means it has one foot in the grave.  Five stars is the best.

Via Internet search, we can find sites which list banks in our area, and
what their FDIC ratings are, and other info.  It is not as well organized
for other kinds of financial institutions, some of which have better
insurance funds than the FDIC.

There are also both government, and better-business-bureau type resources
which tell us what kinds of complaints other consumers have had against
institutions, and how they were resolved.  I don't care if there are a lot
of complaints.  I care that they are resolved swiftly, politely, and with
justice.

Then after finding high star, or equivalent, institutions, which apparently
behave in a civilized way, my next due diligence interests include rate
competitiveness, and ease of access to their services.

As you probably know by now, this story is now claimed to be a hoax by the
original forum poster. The Independent has this update:

"Since this story was posted, Mr Marsala has claimed that his original post
was a hoax and written as a marketing stunt, but that it had happened to a
client of his in 2006. Contacted by The Independent, Mr Marsala said that
the post was guerilla [*] marketing for another, unnamed, company."

ServerFault has deleted the original question.

The real RISK is that these days, anyone can post anything to just about any
popular forum and have it taken up and printed by the major news networks
without any checking or verification. As if to illustrate this point, one of
the sidebars to this story is a link to the story "Women considered to write
better code than men as long as they don't reveal their gender, study
suggests"
<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/women-better-code-men-github-study-a6870836.html">http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/women-better-code-men-github-study-a6870836.html</a>

This story reports on a paper "authored by a group of six students from
California Polytechnic State University and North Carolina State University,
[which] has been published online, *but is not yet peer-reviewed.*" (my
emphasis).

So: some students wrote a paper, put it on a web site, and it gets picked up
by major news networks: before it has even been peer-reviewed.

"A lie can travel halfway around the world before the truth can get its
boots on" (Incorrectly attributed to Mark Twain: but the truth is still
trying to catch up with the incorrect attribution!)

(really, someone who claims the original error, and then follows it up with
then claiming that he got the if / of command reversed when attempting a
recovery was a good clue).
