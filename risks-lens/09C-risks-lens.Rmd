# Limitations and other notes

## Limitations

Rankings are sensitive to data cleaning steps and misclassifications. Synonyms and changing terminology, which often overlap for years, reduce the visibility of some topics.

* There is a long tail of possible data corrections, including misspellings in the original, differences in US and British spellings, and sometimes overly blunt regular expressions used to clean the source text. I manually corrected for some where I noticed a word variant showing up in one of the plots; this has the effect of boosting the signal of n-grams that were already rising to the top. I wasn't thorough or completely consistent. Since we are focused on the n-grams that are most common, this long tail need not be resolved along its length for us to have an interesting data set.
* Preferred terms change, and their use overlaps in time. For example, "cellular phone" and "cellular telephone" gave way to "cell phone" in the US and "mobile phone" most other places. I transformed all of these terms to "mobile phone", so we don't lose this important topic. Another example: "e-voting", "online voting", and "internet voting"; in this case I did not attempt to consolidate them into one term, assuming "vote" or "voting" would rise on its own merits. In contrast, I did transform "fake news" into "fake_news" so we don't lose this important concept in the unigram plots.
* While I did review and correct `spaCy`'s classification of the most common nounphrases, I could do more to correct  misclassifications, for example, organizations or media misclassified as persons and vice versa. I used `spacyr`, which is is a wrapper for the `spaCy` library. I used the medium-sized English language model (en_core_web_md); see https://spacy.io/models/en#en_core_web_md.
* In addition to excluding predefined stop words, I removed the following words, because they are not interesting, or (as in the case of "risk", "computer", "system" and "software), they are too common:

```{r uninteresting-words-part2}

tibble(
  words = sort(uninteresting_words)
  ) %>%
  mutate(id = row_number() %/% 6 * 6) %>%
  group_by(id) %>%
  mutate(my_string  = glue_collapse(words, sep = ", ", last = "") ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  distinct(my_string) %>%
  gt() %>%
  tab_header(
    title = '"Uninteresting" words',
    subtitle = 'Excluded from unigrams and bigrams'
    ) %>%
  cols_label(my_string = "")

```

* Since submissions' body text often includes a signature section at the end, I removed the following names of companies, places, and submitters. I also removed media sources that were commonly mentioned. I am not suggesting the people with the names included below are uninteresting people! Quite the contrary, as frequent contributors to the RISKS Forum, it's necessary to filter out their names so that the topics they write about (rather than their names) rise to the top. Likely I could do more to filter out words in signatures. It's possible that I misclassified some people below as *authors* when in fact they were the *subject* of posts.

```{r uninteresting-places-company-media-peoplenames-part2}

tibble(
  words = c(sort(companies), sort(places), sort(people), sort(media))
  ) %>%
  mutate(id = row_number() %/% 5 * 5) %>%
  group_by(id) %>%
  mutate(my_string  = glue_collapse(words, sep = ", ", last = "") ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  distinct(my_string) %>%
  gt() %>%
  tab_header(
    title = '"Uninteresting" words',
    subtitle = 'Excluded from unigrams and bigrams'
    ) %>%
  cols_label(my_string = "")

```

* To improve clarity and accuracy in representation, I made other small transformations and corrections not detailed here.
