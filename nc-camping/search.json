    "text": "4.1 What is the occupancy rate at NC campgrounds, and when are they fullest?\nSince the data set does not include a declared number of sites per facility+site_type that is reliable, I calculate the daily and weekly percent occupancy as the percent of the maximum recorded occupancy for the campground + site type over the years of interest.\nPercent occupancy is defined as follows, for all facilities offering reservations at the time:\n\nDaily: mean percent of occupancy for that day that year, or for that day averaged over multiple years\nWeekly: weighted mean percent of occupancy for that week\n\n\nLimitations\n\nI am looking at 2009-2017, since the data in 2018 and 2019 are unreliable, and usage patterns in 2020 were not typical. In some plots I further subset the data in the interest of readability.\nIs 100% occupancy rate the same as max occupancy? I cannot determine that from the data. Can one assume that each campground + site type reached 100% occupancy at least once? If so, then yes, max occupancy would mean 100% occupancy.\nThis method may under-estimate occupancy rates in earlier years if facilities added additional inventory of an existing site_type. I am unwilling to assume that every facility+site_type reached maximum occupancy every year, so I cannot calculate a yearly max. Since I am using all facilities (not limited to ones offering reservations in 2009), if a facility added additional inventory of an existing site_type, prior years will under-report occupancy rate.\nSome sites have a mix of reservable and non-reservable sites. When campers show up and take a campsite, does it show up in the reservations.gov as a reservation on the start_date? Are there campsite still using the honor system, where campers deposit payment during their stay and a park staff person picks it up later. If so, are these entered into the reservation system and do they show up in this data set?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Campgrounds with highest average occupancy by year and site type\n\n\n\n\n\nThe difference in occupancy rates off-season and during the summer are not as different as I expected. This may be due to the climate in NC: the most pleasant times to camp are in the spring and fall. Scouting and other community groups are most likely to camp in the off-season (while school is in session).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: NC camping highest average occupancy by year and site type\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen considering only Friday and Saturday nights, which are the most popular nights for camping:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: NC camping highest average occupancy by year and site type (weekends only)"

    "text": "5.1 How far ahead do people reserve?\nAs one might expect, sites in limited supply are booked earlier: more than a third of group sites and more than a quarter of of cabins are booked six months before the start date. In contrast: consistently, only a third of tent sites are reserved 30 days in advance.\nIt looks like in the early years one could reserve most cabins with 6 months lead time. Then for 2012 and later years the cabin policy changed to 12 months lead time.\nTent, RV, and equestrian sites can be reserved six months in advance.\nThe data for 2018 and 2019 seem to have some errors, which are visible in the upper right of each plot: why are there order dates after start_date? These are the only two years in which this pattern is visible in the plots.\nI note again here that some parks have sites that are first-come, first-serve (i.e., they are not reservable). By definition those sites do not show up here.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: Reservation-to-start date patterns - by year\n\n\n\n\n\nThere has been a general trend towards reserving earlier:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: Reservation-to-start date patterns - by site type\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plots above mask differences in campgrounds. As you would expect some parks are more popular then others, with a greater portion of the reservations occurring earlier. Over the years, most properties are seeing earlier reservations. Swan Cabin is experiencing the opposite trend.\nThe most popular group campgrounds seem to be Cove Creek Upper and Lower Group Camp, and Kuykendall Group Camp. Other group campsites are included with other site types, so if they have the same dynamic, it’s not visible in these plots.\nCabins and Group Camps are the most likely to show a linear-like increase in reservations over time (after the early birds reserve as soon as reservations open).\n\n\n\n\nDavidson River and Big Creek have about 50% of tent sites booked 60 days before start date. Most don’t achieve that until 30 days or fewer before start date. It’s interesting that 6 of the 32 campgrounds started offering reservations through recreation.gov in recent years. I assume in prior years these sites were not reservable.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3: Reservation-to-start date patterns - tents\n\n\n\n\n\nCove Creek and Kuykendall group camps seem most popular, with nearly half the group reservations made a year in advance–as soon as the reservations opened. Next most popular are by Cataloochee and White Pines. Briar Bottom and North Mills River have seen remarkable increases in early reservations in recent years.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.4: Reservation-to-start date patterns - group sites\n\n\n\n\n\nWash Creek looks like the only equestrian camp to allow bookings a year in advance. Among the rest, Cataloochee has the most consistent reservation pattern over the years.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.5: Reservation-to-start date patterns - horse sites\n\n\n\n\n\nWith RV sites, Lake Powhatan and Smokemont have the biggest early surge when reservations open six months in advance.\nWhile Powhatan has been 75% booked 30 days in advance, Linville Falls has been less than 50% booked 15-20 days ahead.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.6: Reservation-to-start date patterns - rv sites\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the camps that allow cabin reservations a year in advance, Balsam Lake books faster than Great Island or Long Point. Of those that take bookings six months in advance, Swan books faster than Cheoah Point.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.7: Reservation-to-start date patterns - cabins"

    "section": "7.1 What’s possible given this data set?",
    "text": "7.1 What’s possible given this data set?\nI found five important limitations in the data:\n\nrecreation.gov mostly processes reservations for federal facilities. It does not process reservations for state-owned public campgrounds in North Carolina. NC State Parks use ReserveAmerica.com instead, thus the campgrounds closest to my home in the Jordan Lake State Recreation Area and my favorite at Mount Mitchell are not included in this data set. As noted at www.ncparks.gov/find-a-park:\n\nThere are 41 places that are currently part of the North Carolina State Parks system: 34 parks, four recreation areas, and three staffed state natural areas.\n\nSome campsites are not reservable, and some may not be reservable in the off season. So by definition, use of these sites will not show up in this data set.\nSome campsites have become reservable during the years covered in this data set. For example, the NPS campgrounds at Cape Hatteras: Oregon Inlet and Frisco started taking reservations in 2015, and Cape Point started in 2016. When looking at multi-year growth, including these campgrounds unduly inflates growth rates.\nAs is visible in the per-campground trend data in Section 3.2.1 Camping person-nights by park, there are a lot of outliers in the data in 2018, 2019, and 2020. Thus I have varied the end year as I saw fit to communicate trends most clearly. Likely there are two causes to these anomalies:\n\nData for 2018 and first half of 2019 are less reliable than other years as explained in the 2018 history readme:\n\nDue to the transition between Rec.gov vendors the FY 2018 historical reservation data has not been fully verified for accuracy and completeness.\n\nIn 2020 due the the COVID-19 pandemic, people changed their behavior significantly, and camping facilities were closed for some periods of the year. For example, I assume that group campsites were used less frequently, and group size was smaller than earlier years.\n\nAs noted at trailandsummit.com the definition of “standard”, “tent” and “RV” overlap, which means counts and trends below that distinguish among these categories would not reflect the experience of campers, for example, in the availability of a campsite for them:\n\nIn most campgrounds, the term “standard campsite” is interchangeable with a “basic campsite.” Like basic sites, standard campsites usually have a driveway, a picnic table, and a fire ring or grill, and are normally reserved for groups of 6 people or less. Depending on the type of campground, standard sites may be suitable for tents or RVs, though they’re mostly used by tent campers. This is because most standard sites have driveways that are only suitable for smaller campers and campervans. That being said, in RV-only campgrounds, standard campsites may refer to a site where you get everything listed above, plus a simple electric hookup, but no water or sewer.\n\n\nGiven there are no RV-only campgrounds among these federally-owned facilities in NC, I am recognizing all “standard” sites as “tent” sites."

So comparing later years with a 2009 baseline provides our best view of year-to-year increases in inventory in the parks. This includes some new or existing parks coming on-line as well, as seen above in the parks that have data only for very recent years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.9: Facilities newly offering additional site type for reservation\n\n\n\n\n\nStarting in 2009 each year saw a very small number of campgrounds adding newly reservable overnight site types. Again, these are for the whole USA.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.10: Facilities newly offering additional site type for reservation - by site type\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt seems like normal growth in in 2009 and following years as facilities added additional types of sites and perhaps some new facilities opened. The overall compound annual growth rate1 between 2009 and 2020 was 2.6%, with some differences in the kinds of sites:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.11: Growth rate in facilities offering site type for reservation - by year\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.3.2 Summary by state\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Public parks with overnight campingwith reservations at recreation.gov in 2020\n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      facility_state\n      n_parks\n      \n        Number of parks offering site type\n      \n    \n    \n      tent\n      cabin\n      group\n      rv\n      equestrian\n      shelter\n      management\n      other1\n    \n  \n  \n    (not_specified)\n106\n75\n8\n13\n13\n1\n2\n4\n3\n    AK\n202\n16\n186\n2\n7\n\n\n\n\n    AL\n19\n19\n\n1\n\n\n\n1\n\n    AR\n83\n80\n2\n11\n11\n\n\n13\n1\n    AZ\n101\n44\n18\n55\n4\n5\n1\n1\n\n    CA\n460\n303\n33\n164\n25\n20\n1\n28\n5\n    CO\n190\n136\n26\n40\n23\n6\n1\n5\n\n    CT\n1\n1\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n    FL\n23\n13\n1\n8\n6\n\n\n1\n2\n    GA\n34\n32\n1\n8\n5\n1\n\n7\n1\n    HI\n1\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    IA\n21\n20\n\n6\n\n\n\n1\n\n    ID\n179\n90\n51\n69\n2\n2\n3\n3\n2\n    IL\n20\n17\n\n5\n1\n\n\n1\n\n    IN\n4\n4\n1\n1\n3\n\n\n\n\n    KS\n35\n33\n\n18\n\n1\n\n2\n\n    KY\n34\n29\n1\n7\n5\n2\n\n4\n1\n    LA\n1\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    MA\n6\n\n5\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n    MD\n15\n9\n1\n8\n1\n1\n1\n\n\n    ME\n4\n4\n\n3\n3\n\n\n\n\n    MI\n87\n57\n3\n19\n3\n2\n\n2\n2\n    MN\n35\n33\n3\n7\n2\n1\n\n1\n1\n    MO\n53\n49\n1\n21\n2\n1\n\n7\n1\n    MS\n21\n20\n\n2\n2\n\n\n5\n\n    MT\n187\n50\n111\n34\n7\n1\n5\n2\n1\n    NC\n58\n33\n6\n18\n10\n8\n\n3\n1\n    ND\n13\n10\n1\n2\n1\n1\n\n1\n\n    NE\n4\n4\n\n2\n\n\n\n1\n\n    NH\n16\n11\n3\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n    NJ\n1\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    NM\n30\n17\n\n18\n2\n2\n2\n1\n\n    NV\n16\n12\n\n6\n7\n\n1\n\n\n    NY\n3\n2\n\n1\n1\n\n\n\n\n    OH\n5\n4\n\n2\n1\n\n\n1\n\n    OK\n58\n54\n\n16\n2\n2\n\n6\n1\n    OR\n306\n192\n57\n69\n14\n17\n3\n7\n4\n    PA\n25\n21\n4\n5\n4\n1\n2\n2\n1\n    SC\n12\n9\n\n3\n4\n1\n\n1\n1\n    SD\n17\n13\n1\n2\n2\n1\n\n\n\n    TN\n40\n33\n\n13\n9\n2\n\n8\n1\n    TX\n79\n74\n\n36\n11\n8\n21\n9\n\n    UT\n200\n123\n20\n130\n23\n7\n1\n9\n3\n    VA\n43\n24\n4\n17\n6\n2\n\n2\n1\n    VT\n5\n5\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n    WA\n151\n93\n18\n56\n4\n1\n1\n9\n\n    WI\n31\n28\n1\n7\n1\n1\n\n\n\n    WV\n16\n12\n1\n6\n\n\n\n1\n\n    WY\n76\n41\n23\n18\n3\n1\n1\n\n\n    Total\n3,127\n1,951\n592\n932\n230\n99\n48\n149\n33\n  \n  \n  \n    \n      1 Other includes 'boat in', 'anchorage', 'mooring', 'zone' and a few others\n    \n  \n\n\nFigure 7.12: Public parks in USA with overnight camping reservations via recreation.gov\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.3.3 Limitations in USA-level data\nThe USA-level data does not include all reservable camping sites, presumably because they use a different reservation system. For example:\n\nYellowstone Hotel and Cabins are not reservable via recreation.gov, but campgrounds and backcountry camping permits are\nYosemite Creek Campground is not reservable, but other Yosemite campgrounds are\nNo overnight facilities in Hawaii are reservable (are there any?)\n\nIn contrast: Great Smokey Mountain National Park campgrounds are all reservable.\nSome recreation areas allow camping; only two in the data set are reservable; they are not included here."

    "text": "7.4 Possible future explorations\n\nReview occupancy rates by day and week. The number of weeks at max occupancy suggests that I may be under-counting the number of days at max occupancy. I wonder if the inconsistent results for RVs at the coast and cabins in the mountains are due to changes in the inventory over time compounded by inaccurate data due to the 2018 hand-over to another vendor? To what degree are the categories with more data also compromised?\nI wonder whether growth at the NC state parks was similar over this time period. My hunch is that the NC parks are more often at max occupancy, so the growth rate may be capped. If the same data were available from ReserveAmerica.com perhaps I would do a similar analysis. Supposedly there is an API, however the comments there suggest it is no longer available. The North Carolina Division of Parks and Recreation is part of the N.C. Department of Natural and Cultural Resources. Do they make the data available? I couldn’t find it in any of the NC government-sponsored open data portals. Might they make the data available if I ask?\nFor full-USA view, it might be interesting to normalize n_parks and/or n_sights by state population or state area to see which states have a relative abundance or lack of federal campgrounds and/or campsites.\nWhich facilities have the most campers coming from out of state?"
